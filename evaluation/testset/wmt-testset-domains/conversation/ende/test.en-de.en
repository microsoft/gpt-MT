The rider try to leave the order on the Security but he did not accept it.
That is why the order was taken by the rider as he goes.
OK, you can try performing a factory reset on your device to see if this fixes the problem.
I understand that you have already tried turning it off and back on with no success, correct?
Thanks for waiting.
Wrong order was selected earlier that's why I got confused earlier.
I thought it was already delivered.
I checked the correct order and I can see here that the rider is currently trying to pick it up now.
He will be there in 10-15 minutes.
I know it is in chinese, you don't need to use your device's internal function nor the correct language to perform these last steps sent.
