Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference: Students Take the Leading Role, Research Achievements Amaze People - Xinhua News Agency
Washing hands with air, diagnosing diseases by breath, accurately tracing the source of smog - Last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 Academic Annual Meeting, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are all students, and the research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, humanities and education. Starting from a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won awards both domestically and internationally.
Biosensors: Your Family Health Check Doctor
The College of Biomedical Engineering doctoral student Zhang Diming's team demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a gentle breath, and this set of instruments can preliminarily detect your physical health from the components of the gas you exhale."
Zhang Diming explained that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling, the health report will be displayed on the phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health status generally measure physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new type of material, which targets chemical elements. Its sensitive "sense of smell" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Intelligent Surgical Lamp: Doctor's High-energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also being used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
The graduate students Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei from the School of Optoelectronics Science and Engineering have opened up new ideas in the shortcomings of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED shadowless surgical lights.
"Many early disease detections and incomplete removals are related to the lights used in the doctor's operating room."
Shen Junfei said, for example, during early cancer screening, if doctors cannot promptly identify all tumor tissues, the cancer cells will continue to spread later.
This intelligent surgical lamp has four lamp discs, which enhance the contrast of different tissues under illumination by adjusting the spectrum.
During the surgical procedure, doctors can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and shadowless rate of the light spot according to the needs of the surgery and personal habits.
This intelligent surgical lamp has been tested in hospitals such as the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine and the Children's Hospital affiliated with Zhejiang University School of Medicine, receiving positive feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water-saving and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands by rinsing with water, at most rubbing some soap or squeezing some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
As long as we stand on the device's sink, our weight can compress the air and expel it.
It's like an air pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and combines with the water.
This way, we can wash our hands clean!
The color reaction and bacterial residue tests show that the effect of washing hands with this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force, which can ensure the cleanliness and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among numerous top universities in the world and won the only gold award.

A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates I have besides my driver's license!
Spreading the knowledge: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue actions taken during sudden incidents, that is, rescue efforts before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, there is actually a period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of an ambulance, and it is this period of time that is most critical.
This is the time when emergency treatment is needed.
If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's so important for the people around us to know first aid!
When someone around us falls down, we can rescue them with professional knowledge instead of standing there foolishly, unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
"In China, according to official data, there are three million accidental deaths every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest."
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15%.
In Las Vegas casinos and hotels, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it's less than 1%.
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person suffers from sudden cardiac arrest, loses their breath, and their heartbeat stops, pinching the person's Renzhong acupoint will have no effect.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to possibly save a person.
I found that very few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when something happens, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Perhaps it could even save a person's life!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to complete before I turn 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I really did achieve it!
Next, I'm going to take exams for other certificates I want, planning to get a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate. To take this exam, it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate first, so actually, the first aid certificate is quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#
There's only one shrimp dumpling for 13 yuan!?
Never tried
Why doesn't #NAME# write clearly?
One costs 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# missed delivering a meal, and this time they only gave me one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because I clearly saw that the code was valid when I entered it before.
First, the conclusion: I personally think that "Four Seas" is a bad film in all aspects, in every sense of the word.
But if you say that this movie doesn't have a single highlight, that's not true either, at least the soundtrack selection is pretty good.
There are many types of bad movies, one kind is those that can make you fall asleep soundly in the cinema, another kind is those that make you feel indignant after watching. "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han really has an unparalleled talent.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creation from a series of novels, indescribable, with as many flaws as the trench coat on Little Marco's body.
After watching it, you may even doubt whether there is any hidden metaphor implied by the director, but after careful consideration, you find that it is actually just a pile of shit.
First, let me briefly mention some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, relying on his grandmother for survival.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an old man in the neighborhood to drive a minivan to take her to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people take a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow??
He and his father are very relieved about this.
And then the old man didn't say anything more.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the female protagonist's brother obtain a business license?
Why can the island's street racing gangsters easily close off a section of mountain road??
Then the truck carrying steel bars stopped by the side of the road, and even the truck driver couldn't be found anywhere nearby.
This prop feels too obvious, doesn't it?
Why would a small-time hoodlum with a bad credit record and suspected illegal activities become an auxiliary police officer?
Why not report usury to the police, and in the movie, the police specifically asked if there were any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn't know how to use a room card to open the door at a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the hotel owner but can't, so they sleep outside the room door for the night?
This inexplicable plot is pervasive throughout the entire film, and the absurdity of the storyline is so extreme that recalling them causes me pain.
Apart from the plot, what's worse is the theme of the movie, or rather, the movie has no theme at all; it's just a detestable patchwork monster.
At the beginning of the movie, you might think he wants to make a comedy. After 20 minutes, you guess it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you feel it could be a drama reflecting the difficulties of small-town youth. After watching it, you don't even know what you've seen, followed by deep self-doubt. Why would you go to the cinema to appreciate feces during the New Year?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various types of movies. For example, if you want to make a movie about a motorcycle rider, you can combine inspirational and comedy elements and then tell the audience how a talented rookie gradually achieves success step by step.
If you want to shoot a romance film, then just honestly tell the story of the entanglements between the small-town youth who loves riding motorcycles and the waitress girl.
If you want to reflect reality, at the very least, your plot cannot contain things that contradict the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin Zheng played just got burned, and then there's the character who can still sing), you can't come up with some ideas that even Kennedy can't stand to watch.
As for the female lead, she is obviously not mentally challenged, but in some aspects, she acts like a 5-year-old child. I really don't know if this is due to her acting skills or the director's requirements.
There is also something I don't quite understand: why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies?
Arranging such a movie during the Spring Festival, is it to annoy the audience?

Inspection well concrete module production and processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment features and advantages:
Yixin inspection well block brick machine equipment is widely used in coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures as a new type of masonry material.
For example: various inspection wells, rainwater inlets, square ditches, septic tanks, and small structures for drainage and water storage facilities, as well as bridge abutments, etc.
The advantage of building inspection wells with concrete modules is that the four sides of the module (up, down, left, and right) are all concave-convex groove structures, forming a chain lock when combined and built.
The shear resistance of well wall masonry is far superior to that of smooth friction masonry construction.
The module is a hollow structure. After the combination and construction, the longitudinal holes are connected, and the transverse holes are penetrated. After the core is poured, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a secondary reinforcement and waterproofing role.
The module is equipped with reinforcement slots in both vertical and horizontal directions, and the horizontal and vertical reinforcements correspondingly enhance the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the use of concrete inspection well modules to build inspection wells and drainage wells makes it less likely for them to collapse, sink, or leak. The mechanical properties of the well wall modules are stable, the operation is simple, and the forming dimensions are standard.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control is equipped with data input and output devices, one-key touch LCD display to monitor the entire mechanical operation process, realizing ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of material ratio, density operation, safety logic control, and fault diagnosis system.
The well wall module hydraulic system adopts single-cylinder hydraulic transmission and double-cylinder hydraulic transmission.
Independent hydraulic integrated station, avoiding the impact of host vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system's operation.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment batching box moves forward, the mold box rises, the storage box door closes, the automatic conveyor pallet is transported, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system, thereby reducing mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment adopts imported computers, electrical appliances, sealing parts and hydraulic parts, ensuring the equipment's overall performance is stable and reliable.
The well wall module mechanical vibration platform adopts integral steel plate, with the table surface line cutting and mold without welding points, allowing the filling box to swing freely and guide, effectively reducing mechanical wear.
Reduce mold load, combine filling and encryption amplitude, adopt integrated, full synchronization, platform vibration, mold vibration, to ensure the solidification effect is achieved.
Well wall module mechanical vibration machinery, computer automatic control amplitude adjusts amplitude according to the cost performance of raw materials, no wear braking, thus extending the service life and reducing costs.

Chongqing vocational schools pilot modern apprenticeship system, enrollment is equivalent to being a prospective employee - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for pilot training will also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees by the pilot companies.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and employment procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified. In accordance with the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises shall sign tripartite agreements. For apprentices aged 16 but not yet 18, agreements must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise, specifying the rights and interests of all parties, as well as the specific positions, teaching content, and rights protection for on-the-job training of apprentices.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-job training and job transfer training for enterprise employees.
Pilot schools need to reform talent cultivation models.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot program takes the training period as one pilot cycle, and the internship duration for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, with the on-the-job internship generally lasting for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management model should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form a study group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each training position.
According to the plan, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has identified 60 municipal-level secondary vocational modern apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot program, training a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of piloting first and then promoting, and gradually advancing from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training, and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and increase the employment rate and employment quality of students in corresponding positions.

South African doctor: Although Omicron has strong transmission, most cases are mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although it spreads more quickly.
According to the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a medical organization consisting of more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng Province reports that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughs, which are similar to flu-like symptoms.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have needed to be hospitalized.
Pilai said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are originally more likely to develop severe cases due to coronavirus infections.
He said that compared to this, during the previous Delta outbreak, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people have to be hospitalized within a few days.
Two weeks after the Omicron variant was first reported in southern Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases: Among the COVID-19 patients hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while in the early outbreak cases in South Africa, the death rate reached 20%.
Director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying: "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early, and we need to obtain later-stage data."
Under normal circumstances, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks. "
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Hauden Province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been given away!

Education Commentary: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we draw an analogy to the famous public service advertisement slogan "No trade, no killing," then in a good environment without the demand for "abduction," the whole society works together to prevent and combat abduction, making the act of abduction unprofitable, high-risk, and high-cost, so that such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the child abduction information emergency release platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has been launched.
This is an internet information platform created for establishing an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and promptly recovering abducted children.
I heard that this App is called "Reunion", and I immediately felt a strong sense of warmth.
The new technology is not only named "literary and artistic", full of emotions, but also properly applied in informatization, practical and effective.
Anti-abduction law enforcement's primary goal is to find and rescue abducted children, ensuring their personal safety and freedom.
Next comes the trial and punishment of the suspect.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed with many "big words".
But before the trafficking case is solved, priority should be given to the personal safety of the victims.
The matter is of varying importance and urgency. Under the urgent goal of "seeking rescue," topics with diverse opinions and great controversy, such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death without exception," can be temporarily set aside for cautious discussion; but the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
According to the investigation experience of such cases, human traffickers tend to quickly leave the crime scene after succeeding.
The longer the search for the abducted child is delayed, the farther the child may be from their parents, and the more difficult it becomes to solve the case.
In this situation, adopting practical measures like the "Reunion" platform, which directly helps in solving cases and finding children, is indeed a pragmatic action.
After all, "fighting against abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system.
Combat crime, protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the meticulous enforcement of law, all require the implementation of the care for "protecting the young and supporting the weak."
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking can be improved from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is when a family of three is resting at the train station, the parents are sound asleep, and when they wake up, they find that their child is missing.
You cannot expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least have a considerable sense of protection.
Parents take turns resting, or placing their children under reliable protection, are the most basic measures to prevent child abduction.
From another perspective of the police crackdown on trafficking crimes, the buyers of abducted children should also be concerned and punished.
A single illegal act is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory punishment for the crime of child trafficking starts at 5 years; in particularly serious cases, it can be up to the death penalty, and confiscation of property.
The starting point for punishment is high, and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the general trend of "lighter punishment," the crime of child trafficking obviously belongs to a more severe punishment.
Even now, there are still quite a few cases of abduction and trafficking happening every year.
It can be seen that some people have outdated concepts in raising children and have a weak sense of law.
The legal education for this group of people should be carried out simultaneously.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, it cannot rely solely on strict law enforcement by officials.
If the kidnapping "market" is widespread, traffickers are blinded by greed, constantly innovating trafficking methods, forming a "battle of wits" situation with law enforcers, and anti-trafficking actions will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two main categories and five levels: Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is the oil obtained by mechanically cold pressing fresh olive fruits and removing impurities through filtration and other treatments.
According to the different acidity levels, it can be divided into three categories:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The highest grade and highest quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
Excellent taste, with a delicate and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: Slightly higher acidity, but not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: The taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or becoming "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Ordinary Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to balance the taste and color, with an acidity of less than 1.5%, presenting a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: It is an olive oil obtained by extracting from pomace through the solvent method and refining.
After seeing the grade classification, you should have noticed that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You should know that olives are like grapes used for making wine; olives from different regions and different varieties will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best growing area for olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of olive oil, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity, and precipitation.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, other areas can only be sporadically planted in suitable habitats.
Main production areas and origins (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on, as well as countries with similar climates in the southern latitudes, such as Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
Olive harvesting month:
From March to June every year, it is the time for olive trees to bloom and bear fruit. From July to October, the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the fruit picking season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, including oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the fats discovered so far.
Democracy Summit concludes, Biden says the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The online "Summit for Democracy," convened by US President Biden and attended by government, civil society, and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, concluded on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in his closing remarks that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwan government representative and Minister without Portfolio Tang Feng, as well as Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Joshua Wong, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke on the second day of the summit.
Biden said: "We know how difficult the work ahead of us is."
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, because as I have said before, as this summit demonstrates, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the faint flame of freedom; it burns in the hearts of people all over the world and in every corner of the globe. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
He said, "As government leaders, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
"Democracy Summit" on the second day, the themes are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and countering authoritarianism, as well as fighting back against digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day happens to be "International Human Rights Day".
United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech that day that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "Now is the time to reaffirm our shared values and positions, as well as democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality issues, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolutely condemning all forms of populism, nativism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding participants to continue paying attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China, such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has been accepting the rise of China, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Joshua Wong also called for the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Perhaps some of you are afraid of offending General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, and perhaps some of you haven't realized the threat (the CCP) poses to our democratic values.
And this is the reason for our failure.
This is also the reason why we must change. "
Taiwan's Executive Yuan Minister Tang Feng attended the roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values" and released the "National Statement" through a video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said: "At the time when democracy is thriving in Taiwan, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy, and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, showing signs of a global democratic regression.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without lockdowns and combat fake information without taking things off the shelves. "
On the second day of the "Democracy Summit", while the agenda was underway, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities from several countries, including China and North Korea, who were deemed to have seriously violated human rights. At the same time, investment restrictions were imposed on a Chinese company that was identified as using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the mouth-watering chicken delivered by the restaurant is raw.
Want to try tennis, but afraid I can't stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price often has a positive correlation with the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then under normal circumstances, the expensive ones will be friendlier than the cheap ones. This kind of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial waste.
Their intensity is very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, the hard ball can't withstand it, and it's difficult for experts to control.
The underlying logic and subtext is that tennis is so difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it, and they also know you're not willing to buy expensive ones. So they make a cheap racket to fool you, and after you play a couple of times, you won't play again. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel heartbroken.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. At that time, come back to me to buy the expensive ones, and I'll make money twice.
Suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a better second-hand racket, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets don't sell for high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200 yuan, isn't it nice to enjoy the experience of a thousand-yuan racket?
Quite friendly for beginners, but once past the beginner stage, it becomes mediocre. However, most people, especially girls, cannot get past the beginner stage.
The order has been delayed for delivery multiple times.
May I ask if you can help follow up on this?
Postpone
Thank you
So, actually, I already have credit?
Do I need to place a new order next? Can I ignore the previous one?

In fact, there are many dressing and matching tips for girls with slightly plump bodies.
Girls with a plump body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long; the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the chubby part of the thigh.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If it's too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you wear clothes that are divided into three sections - upper, middle, and lower - it will make you appear taller naturally. Wearing a top, skirt, and long socks in different colors will create a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard for slightly overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are a good way to hide your body fat. The elegant and noble black short skirt is also the first choice for slightly overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black skirts, can make you look thinner.
If your calves are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too eye-catching.
The more popular, the better; the colors should not be too bright.
To avoid drawing attention to your legs and feet, giving people a feeling of being overweight.
For slightly chubby girls, it is important to talk about the tips for good clothing collocation.

Of course, slightly chubby girls also have their own considerations when wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops with the same color as the skirt, which will make your plump figure have the effect of increasing height.
Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN combination for summer!
If you are a girl with a plump upper body but thin legs, it is recommended to choose a gorgeous short dress.
Not only can it cover your big belly, but it can also show off your strengths.
A-line skirts are slimming and more suitable for plus-sized girls. Choose tighter tops to create a sense of layering, which will make you look slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, chubby girls can also try.
Slightly plump girls can also wear fashionable clothes.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and matching, slightly chubby girls can also become the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing collocation, also exercise more in life, and strive to get rid of the label of slightly overweight girls as soon as possible 😄

Girl becomes arrow target to raise funds for sister: "Thinking it's just a flesh wound makes it better" - Xinhua News Agency
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board at Hangzhou Wulin Square, with the words "Human Target, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a "Hangzhou girl willingly becoming a 'target' to raise funds for her sister" went viral in the friend circle.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person at Hangzhou Wulin Square. The board reads "Human target, ten yuan per arrow," indicating that passersby can pay to use a bow and arrow for shooting.
This behavior has sparked heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch confirmed to a reporter from the Beijing News that the police confirmed that the girl took such extreme actions to raise funds for her sister, but this behavior is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl has already left the local police station yesterday.
Girl's street "arrow target" fundraising warned
In the picture circulated on the internet, a long-haired girl stands in a "human" shape in front of a large wooden board, on which is written in black ink "Human target, ten yuan per arrow." In front of her, another wooden board displays her bank account number, WeChat, and Alipay account information.
The picture sparked controversy after being posted online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "begging behavior for attention", while many others express sympathy for it.
"We discovered the situation around 10 am on the 23rd when we were patrolling near the square, and there were already quite a few onlookers at that time."
The police officer from the nearby Tianshui police station said in an interview with local media that there were two girls running the stall, both around 20 years old, dressed youthfully and beautifully.
Among them, the girl who acted as the "human target" kept crying, asking passers-by to play the game; another girl was helping to shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees, asking everyone for help.
"We have contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising funds for her sister's leukemia treatment."
Last night, the person in charge of publicity at the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau's Xiacheng Branch told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name is Ji Jiali, and she is raising funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since the treatment still requires more than 300,000 yuan in expenses, I couldn't think of a good way to raise funds, so I resorted to this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one girl acted as the target and the other assisted, but neither of them participated. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took photos, which were posted on Weibo.
After the police consulted with the security department, it was determined that the bow and arrow used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate using this eye-catching fundraising method."
After being warned by the police at the police station, she has already left the police station.

Stable performance, no problem with heat dissipation from the four air outlets, worth recommending.
This Acer Shadow Knight Dragon gaming laptop is pretty good, with solid craftsmanship and materials, and a reliable brand!
The price of the Acer Shadow Knight Dragon is not considered expensive.

Appearance material: The appearance is quite cool, the gaming laptop is stylish. Display effect: The screen is very clear, playing games at 1080 is enough.
Buying this laptop feels pretty good, it's really nice. Mainly used for design work, it has a high cost-performance ratio. It's lighter than I imagined and looks better than I expected. The red on the back is a very beautiful wine color, not too garish. Overall, it exceeds my expectations by a lot and is worth the purchase. It's also quite suitable for women.

What was the hottest thing in 2021?
Undoubtedly, it's the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
A while ago, there was a popular article titled "Look! Project Managers Can Compete for Gold Medals in the Olympics." It mentioned that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: moving bricks, going on business trips, and staying up late are the daily routines of project managers, while putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are even more commonplace.
It seems like a joking and teasing article, but it also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the helplessness of the current project management work.
People engaged in project management work are gradually choosing to take some actions to free themselves from the predicament in their work.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (Project Management Professional, an internationally recognized certification) registrations each year, more and more project management practitioners are improving their project management skills through learning.
According to the "China Project Management 20-Year Development Report (1999-2019)": As of September 2019, the total number of PMP® exam applicants nationwide is nearly 600,000, with approximately 420,000 people passing the PMP® certification and about 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global total of PMP® certifications.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" to do things. The ever-changing work environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, can obtaining a PMP guarantee smooth project management work?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas and five major process groups of project management and other related knowledge points, but when it comes to actually managing projects, they are still at a loss.
Many project managers often report the following issues: insufficient understanding of project management, relying solely on personal experience, having project management theories but not knowing how to put them into practice; lacking systematic project management process support, unable to implement in work, inaccurate project estimates, poor control sensitivity, and projects being constantly delayed; unclear division of labor among team members, not knowing how to deal with "old hands" in the team, poor cross-departmental communication and collaboration, making it difficult to advance projects...
Therefore, focusing on product innovation and R&D management for more than a decade, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting has helped many outstanding companies cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and has won honorary titles such as "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base", bringing the "R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" online course.
"R&D Project Manager Special Training Camp" Online Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines a large number of practical cases, tools, and methods from R&D-oriented enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of project managers and embark on the advanced path of your own project management.

Jie Xin advocates rational consumption to consumers on the eve of "Double Twelve" - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year's "Double Eleven" shopping festival saw a nationwide online payment transaction amount of 1.77 trillion yuan, setting a new record compared to previous years.
A wide variety of discount coupons and eye-catching live-streamed sales events once again make consumers exclaim about the benefits they receive. On one hand, this consumption craze makes people marvel at the increasingly strong national consumption power; on the other hand, it is also necessary to calmly think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of "Double Twelve", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a call for rational consumption, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish good consumption awareness and habits, and to reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared to 2019.
Overall, the performance of residents in our country in terms of financial consumption is relatively good, but there are significant differences in various aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low, and the "old and young" will still be the key focus of continuous attention in financial education; the "China Young People's Debt Status Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, and although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, it is quite different from the "excessive extravagance" label attached by the outside world. However, some young people do indeed have excessive consumption and follow-the-trend consumption behaviors, resulting in excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even leading to a gradual increase in social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave in taking on social responsibilities and providing positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Jie Xin has always been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating for consumers to establish a good and correct consumption concept, and actively responding to regulatory calls, taking practical actions to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially the younger generation.
Over the past few years, Jie Xin has been continuously carrying out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and has subtly and reasonably guided the consumption needs of young people through various forms such as launching innovation practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, helping them establish rational consumption concepts, reasonably plan consumption needs, and thereby accumulate wealth for their lives.
On the occasion of Double Twelve, Jie Xin reminds all consumer friends to establish a rational consumption awareness and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, avoid misunderstandings in consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, be sure to plan ahead, live within your means, and repay on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic activities such as buying a car and purchasing a house.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to check whether the relevant institutions have the qualifications to operate.
In the future, Jie Xin will continue to rely on its mature, reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to bring consumers more tailored and diversified services, continuously helping the public improve their financial knowledge, cultivating rational consumption and moderate borrowing concepts, and becoming a lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Gulf Cooperation Council Responds to Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land, sea, and air routes to Qatar.
This crisis was only resolved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, where the Gulf countries signed an agreement mediated by the United States and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
Gulf Arab countries resolved differences to restore relations with Qatar, stemming from the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometer-long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi Crown Prince's visit to the Gulf countries coincides with Iran and major world powers negotiating to save the Iran nuclear deal, known as the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" (JCPOA) - an agreement condemned by Gulf Arab countries for being unable to address Iran's missile issues.
Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and view Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
All Gulf countries believe that without addressing the Iranian missile issue and taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region, the situation is flawed.
In the context of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran failing to satisfy the wishes of the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran held direct talks.
Its goal is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming Gulf Cooperation Council summit will be the first summit of the GCC countries since the dispute between some member states and Qatar was resolved.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing various measures to enable its member countries to fully cooperate in addressing common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf countries.

Known as the loudest supercar exhaust sound in the new mountain area!
This time, our team brings you this car, which is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
Asking price is nearly two million Malaysian Ringgit, annual road tax is over ten thousand Malaysian Ringgit, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Well, I don't know either, but the data says it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h, which is probably when my Myvi reaches 30km/h, others have already reached 100km/h, hmm.
Low-profile body, flamboyant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body, and the unobstructed view of the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
There's no need to say too much about the car models, just Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not necessarily provide!
Too much attention, wherever I go everyone is looking, very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of nice)
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (car owners basically don't care)
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you might not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud; after getting out of the car, you'll instantly go deaf. (But it's still very enjoyable)
The car body is too big, and it's very narrow when parked in a regular parking space. I'm afraid of being hit when the car next door opens its door!
A bit lonely, because there are no opponents on the road (said by the editor themselves, unrelated to the car owner, haha)
Don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your beloved car, welcome to contact us!
More car information you don't know about, find it at The Car Guide / People's Car Journal
Involving a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are believed to be well-known among car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the price of Porsche 911 is also at the million-dollar level!
The day before, a foreign country crashed a million-dollar sports car 911 and a ten-million-dollar supercar Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the results, it makes sense that it's expensive!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of long-term development, which is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, the spirit of universities has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and society, as well as the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have taken on a unique mission different from other social organizations. For universities in our country, which emerged during the crisis of the nation, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the values of "cultivating virtue to benefit the world, and promoting harmony and peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "promoting education to strengthen the country."
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming increasingly evident, and the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent is intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "Overall Plan for Coordinating the Advancement of World-Class Universities and First-Class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move from a major higher education country to a strong higher education country, but also puts forward higher and updated requirements for university development.
How to strive to join the ranks of world-class institutions in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the establishment of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of still having a certain gap, and achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to having firm confidence in goals, paths, and capabilities, universities should also fully leverage three advantages: First, the latecomer advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from and drawing on the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve significant improvements in academic level and education quality; Second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom and connotations accumulated in the 5,000-year history of Chinese civilization, promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, and using this to unite strength, shape the brand, and enhance the image; Third, the institutional advantage, leveraging the superiority of the socialist country's system, strengthening goal-driven efforts, gathering consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate their progress towards the world's advanced level.
It is particularly important to realize that building world-class universities cannot be achieved with a one-size-fits-all approach; each school must highlight its individuality and characteristics while leveraging its strengths.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goal orientation, educational traditions, and resource endowments.
Regarding Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects in running the school: First, we emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talents, building an integrated education environment that combines science, education, and industry, and forming a complete entrepreneurial education ecosystem; Second, we highlight the convergence of interdisciplinary features, promoting the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, creating an institutional environment for interdisciplinary integration, and actively cultivating emerging interdisciplinary subjects and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; Third, we emphasize the characteristics of the school system and social services, carrying out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-academia-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always uphold the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the motto "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligent Learning, Cultivating Virtue, Discerning Truth, and Being Practical", and the collective spirit of "Embracing Diversity, Pursuing Truth and Virtue, Pioneering in Science and Technology, and Serving the Nation" together constitute the latest expression system of the Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height, and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotations and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "embracing rivers and seas" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflecting the mindset of "using the talents of the world for my own purposes," and manifests as drawing on the high-quality concepts of running schools and educating people from world-renowned universities; "cultivating true virtues" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and goodness, referring to the university's pursuit of truth while also receiving the cultivation of virtues and the tempering of character; "leading the people in opening up new fields" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, including the pursuit of new knowledge, innovation in scientific research, as well as reform and development, and breaking with the old and establishing the new; "building our nation" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, stating that universities should always share the glory and humiliation of the nation's destiny.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is precisely the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of education.
"The wise listen to the silent, the insightful see the unformed."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of China's socialist cause with Chinese characteristics, deeply grasp the era orientation and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit inspire each other, thus providing inexhaustible motivation for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

Guangxi University students can take a leave of absence for entrepreneurship for up to 5 years - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19th (Reporter Zhang Ying) - The reporter recently learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Department of Education that in the future, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, relax the suspension of schooling for college students, and extend the suspension of schooling for entrepreneurship for 2 to 5 years based on the original academic system. The time for suspension of schooling for entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time.
To promote the improvement of college students' entrepreneurial and innovative abilities, the Guangxi education, human resources and other departments work together to build entrepreneurial platforms, construct more off-campus practical teaching bases for college students, university science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external guarantees for college students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in various universities and colleges should reach more than 30,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 20,000 square meters for vocational colleges.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and gives priority to supporting students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to change their majors.
University teachers should spend at least two months in industry enterprises every two years for job training, in order to improve their awareness and ability in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Department of Education requires universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training program, striving to ensure that every college student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their time in school.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

As NFTs quickly gain popularity, the crypto community has come up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in the Southeast Asia region, and some residents who lost job opportunities due to the pandemic began to earn a stable income in this game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, incorporating various gameplay elements including NFTs. It is currently the highest-grossing NFT project, with over 3 billion US dollars in transactions to date.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity's daily income exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching "King of Glory".
On August 6th this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" has introduced a new "play-to-earn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer just single characters. In addition to gaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game's ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Upon seeing a piece of news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is that the choice of the company's track, which refers to the choice of the investment target industry, should first choose an industry with a large growth space, at least a market size of more than 100 billion; secondly, choose an industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in 3-5 years; finally, choose an industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
Tactics are about "doing the things right," which means doing things correctly.
And strategy is about "do the right thing", which means doing the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics are about implementation, and above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of increasing the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can consider whether to continue deepening in the current field or expand horizontally into other fields (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of increasing event participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the right event KPIs, achieve the right event goals, such as increasing the participation of target customers, activating high-value dormant customers, and accurately acquiring new customers; on top of increasing DAU (tactical thinking), you can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Born 12 years ago, Bitcoin experienced several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7th, the Central American small country El Salvador will make Bitcoin a legal currency, marking the first time that Bitcoin has become the legal currency of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved for the first time in eight years the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This marks the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market, further expanding the exposure of cryptocurrency investments.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot," which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden in transactions by changing the data structure of the blocks themselves.

The groom really hit the jackpot, a lifetime of happiness, harmonious and beautiful.
The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what was said online. My lover and I look handsome and beautiful in the photos, and we are very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude is also very enthusiastic.
During this trip, not only did we enjoy the beautiful scenery, but we also took beautiful wedding photos and made friends with the photographer.
The wedding photos are so beautiful, praising the photographer and makeup artist to the skies, you guys are really super super professional.

Asian American groups file complaints against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for admissions discrimination - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei) - More than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against discrimination against Asian applicants in the admissions process at three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Association, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington that day.
The chairman of the group, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of prestigious American universities has doubled, but in these three prestigious American universities, the proportion of Asians has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies show that these universities, in the so-called "holistic admissions" process, "long-term and systematically discriminate against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yukong explained that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among the three universities, the admission rate of Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the appeal, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the universities being complained about to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asian students.
At present, the 3 universities being complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had filed a complaint against Harvard University for admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept it for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the appeal also involves American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani educational groups.
Need tableware
Just canceled the order
Why is it still executing
Can you help me check if it has been cancelled?
But I already placed the order at 5:09 in the morning.
Over there is the food ordering hotline, they say they don't know anything.
Is there a phone number to contact them directly?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Zheting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang from a housing agency. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, after discussing the details of purchasing the factory building with the family member of the property owner, Mr. Lin, Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through a bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Factory Deposit Receipt," which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit belongs to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the buyer at double the amount. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week."
However, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, resulting in the delay of signing the house purchase and sale contract.
Considering that both parties failed to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
After much difficulty in finding a suitable house, the deposit was paid, and the house payment was ready. All that was left was to sign the contract with "one last step," but the seller refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao People's Court.
The court holds that since both parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, the defendant cannot be solely blamed, and it should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations were unsuccessful. Therefore, the case should not be subject to the rules of earnest money, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability of returning double the earnest money for breach of contract.
After the first trial judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of due diligence and caution.
Upon signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and other relevant information. Also, specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between both parties during the performance of the contract.
(German Voice Chinese Network) After the "Democracy Summit" ended on Friday, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke on Saturday (December 11th), stating that the United States hosting the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "drawing lines with ideology, turning democracy into a tool and weapon, practicing anti-democracy in the name of democracy, inciting division and confrontation, and shifting domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation', abused unilateral sanctions, instigated 'color revolutions', and caused disastrous consequences."
"Democracy" has long become the "weapon of mass destruction" for the United States to interfere in other countries.
This summit is an action for Biden to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day conference was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries around the world invited to attend, including Taiwan's leader, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying that the United States is not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also international and domestic doubts in the United States, such as criticism that the invited participants include some leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil. Some people suspect that the real intention of the Biden administration is not for democracy but for geopolitical purposes in organizing this summit.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the video democracy summit.
The statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday said, "Today's American-style democracy is showing its pathological state, with money politics, identity politics, party confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, and wealth disparity becoming increasingly severe," and that American democracy is a "rich man's game" built on a foundation of capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, better resist the buffering and impact of authoritarianism, as well as those who blatantly pursue power before the public interest."
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it among every generation, in my view, this is the decisive challenge of our time."
Biden also said that as global democracy and human rights "face ongoing and worrying challenges, democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The United States promises that after this Democracy Summit, it will launch a year-long campaign, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support for independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the physical Democracy Summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
Biden said, "Let all countries implement our commitments and report the progress we have made next year."
Alright, I'm just afraid he sent it to the wrong address.

What is the drinking method for Red Label Whisky?
Everyone has different hobbies. Some people like collecting, some people like gourmet food, and of course, some people like tasting wine. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal in the International Spirits Competition.
Every bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, isn't it a waste of its mellow aroma.
So how do you drink Red Label Whisky?
Let me give you a brief introduction.
Red Label Whiskey drinking method:
Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey is blended from about 35 kinds of Scotch whiskey, with a rich aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whiskey, the rich aroma is accompanied by sweet and smoky flavors.
The entrance is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor.
The wine can be consumed directly with ice, or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whiskey enters the domestic market, and in order to cater to the taste of the locals, Red Label whiskey + cola or Sprite or Fanta and other carbonated drinks become a long-lasting fashion.
These sweet drinks, in addition to neutralizing acidity, can bring visual pleasure and, when added to beverages, have the effect of diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the mouthfeel.
Red label whiskey + lemon slices + sugar cubes (granulated sugar is also fine), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic taste of red square vodka is somewhat sour, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon will bring a refreshing aroma to the drink. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three methods are the best ways to drink red label whiskey. Everyone can use them as a reference to try. I hope the introduction by the editor can help everyone.
Educational Thoughts: How to Make College Exams Fair for Both "Top Students" and "Poor Students" - Xinhua News Agency
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the school leaders, reflecting their confusion about university exams, and proposed to increase the difficulty of exams, change the types of exam questions, and let exams truly reflect the actual level of students.
Indeed, for a long time, university exams have been a "hot topic".
In the university campus, students come from all corners of the country, with varying levels of ability, and different levels of education, resulting in a myriad of learning situations.
For a group with such diverse characteristics, it is inevitable that there will be different feelings when being assessed.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, have a high repetition rate, and are too simple, it will inevitably lead to a completely different feeling.
Students who don't study hard may be able to pass by cramming before the exam. If they try other methods, they might achieve twice the results with half the effort.
As a result, the "poor students" can pass and even get high scores without putting in much effort, while the "top students" who never miss classes and have good homework and notes don't score much higher in exams, creating a "strange situation".
In this view, the concerns raised by Lanzhou Jiaotong University students about issues in university exams are not unfounded, and it is believed that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
From this perspective, we should give a thumbs up to these three students who wrote the letter directly.
In fact, people who have attended college are well aware that cramming for exams, trying various ways to "extract" exam questions from teachers, striving to narrow down the scope of the exam, and seeking "focused tutoring" before the exam are not uncommon phenomena. Even bringing cheat sheets to exams and asking teachers for leniency after the exam are not unheard of.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment orientation, measuring the pass or fail of a university exam depends more on the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific proposition based on this foundation.
Upon entering the undergraduate stage, majors begin to subdivide, and many specialized courses are mainly based on fundamental knowledge.
Without a doubt, whether one has a comprehensive grasp of the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content that university exams aim to assess.
The undergraduate knowledge mainly consists of basic theoretical foundations and common sense of the discipline. In terms of knowledge points, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics learned 20 years ago is still being studied today, and it is still the focus."
However, the fact that the knowledge points remain basically unchanged does not mean that the exam question types are single and the test questions are repetitive.
In many universities, examination questions are usually formed by a question-setting group, and then the test papers are organized by senior teachers in the subject. The grading of the exams is also participated in by all the teachers responsible for the subject, which can to some extent overcome the problem of repeated questions.
To create a set of test questions that conform to the actual teaching and learning situation, the questions should be based on the overall situation of students' learning, with difficulty following a normal distribution. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation, fully analyze the students' learning level, so that the examination questions can dynamically grasp the difficulty and question types, highlighting the examination of basic knowledge while taking into account the examination of abilities, and innovating the design of question types at the same time.
Exams are the baton of university education; the type of exams will determine the corresponding test preparation plans for students. Over time, this will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Regarding the suggestion letter from students, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the school.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out research discussions and course final exams for self-inspection, formulate examination paper proposition and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of examination paper proposition and review links, refine the grading evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of course teaching.
Addressing the issues of single test question types and repeated questions in college examination administration from a systematic perspective is a topic that needs to be faced. Of course, corresponding systems need to be introduced, but the key lies in daily efforts. Teachers need to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation, not only thoroughly understanding the teaching content, but also fully understanding the students' learning situation. By thoroughly understanding both aspects, teaching and learning will be better aligned, forming a positive interaction, and exams will be more in line with reality, allowing both "top students" and "struggling students" to find their place.
If it is not possible to change the branch location for me, can it be changed to delivery instead?
So I don't have to pay extra money, right?
My colleague's order has been delivered.
Can't finish pulling.
GPS, huh? Have we arrived yet?
Jin Furen Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently has no branches.
Before taking the photos, we didn't arrange our time well and changed the schedule twice. Consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
Mrs. Jin's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing.
That was the first time in my life I had ever put on makeup formally, wow~ I can't believe that one day I would become so good-looking, haha.
Xiaojie and another girl (sorry, I can't remember her name) are super patient with makeup, and their makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were shot in Jiangwan City, and luckily the weather was good that day, so we didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes and headwear, and would immediately help us tidy up if there was even a slight issue.
The photographer was also very humorous, and we felt happy after a whole day of taking pictures.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to let the customers delete too many photos. However, when we were choosing photos, really, there was no intention for us to add more photos. We directly chose 24 photos from the package, without adding any extra ones (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos around the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to her 7,000-plus package. I was shocked at the time and was also afraid that I would choose too many).
The photos were fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. I saw two that I didn't think were very good, and they immediately helped me fix them again.
After comparing the photos of my younger sister that were taken before, I feel really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and refreshing, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Lady Jin for wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin is grateful to have your sincere wishes for your happiness and well-being, and a bright future like a brocade!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions must be met to use that $32?
That's good, no need to refund then.
Your rider said they couldn't find it.
Cannot find
But I can't understand the English he speaks.

Sabah 3,200 newborns without birth certificates due to shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper
(Kota Kinabalu, November 11) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the depletion of special anti-counterfeiting paper stocks, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the bureau, Kailu Aminu, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have their information recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued once the anti-counterfeiting paper arrives next week.
At the press conference, he explained the issue of Sabah newspaper's paper printing problems, which had been reported by an online media outlet for as long as 10 months.
He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeit paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by Sabah newspaper is different from other regions, so they cannot borrow the inventory from other states.
Kailu Aminu revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and was then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and immediately proceed with the final stage of printing upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20th) to deliver them to the applicants.
"We will notify the applicants to go to the local branches to collect their birth registration papers."
He added that a total of 24,801 birth certificates have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
Waited from after 7 o'clock until now
Is it almost there?
What I mean is food
I'm waiting again across from #PRS_ORG#

The feeling is not big, but heavy. It's actually not that big to hold with one hand, just a little bit bigger than 15.6 inches. It runs very stable, and there is no noticeable lag. The sound of the fan cooling is lovely, very impressive, and it doesn't keep spinning like a gaming laptop.
The items are pretty good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even gave a backpack, I think it's quite nice.
The store's service was also good, they reminded me to update the bios, and issued the ** in a timely manner.

On the 21st and 22nd, the examination of junior high school students with special talents in Beijing was organized and implemented by the district education commissions.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the enrollment ratio for students with special talents, making the competition for these students even more intense.

Students with sports, art, and technology expertise who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination.
To facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, Dongcheng District continues last year's examination arrangement method, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination sites are divided into examination areas, with time periods divided into hours. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination sites according to the time periods and take the examination in different examination areas.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Chairman: Firmly believe that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during special times - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 - The Chairman of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during this special period.
Recently, Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with the Chairman of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of the China-Bosnia and Herzegovina relationship and said that he visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and was deeply impressed by the excellent organization work of the Chinese side. He firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during this special period. Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnian Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation. Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Ji Ping said that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond."
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting a simple, safe, and exciting event to the world.
Looking forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the preparation of winter sports events, athlete training, and other aspects, the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridging role, taking the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, allowing the people of both countries to "move towards the future together", and wishing the Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Ji Ping, as a special guest, presented the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The event venue continuously plays promotional videos of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, setting up "buffer zone" - State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News Agency

According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region, and municipality determines the scope of port cities and announces it, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
A relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and border residents on both sides frequently travel back and forth.
Implement differentiated management policies by region, changing from a single line of defense against spillover to two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the goal of moving the control point forward, reducing the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the smallest social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local cluster outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as untimely monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, incomplete closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, perfunctory regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items at various stages, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficiently scientific and precise emergency handling of epidemics.
The notice requires efforts in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the shortcomings and weaknesses in port city prevention and control. It emphasizes not to relax, and to carry out prevention and control work scientifically and accurately, weaving a tight and solid defense line against external input.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control with people's livelihood protection work, announce and smooth the livelihood protection hotline, regularly check the potential risks in the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where the open land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.


Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.

One after another, crimes against humanity have aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American "anti-terrorism" war is "the more you fight, the more terror there is."
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the Afghan people; all it has brought is a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.

I accidentally came across the following article, which discusses from a business perspective and a storage period perspective why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning. Although canning is considered deep processing and does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics companies, the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I visited many milk powder factories and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of bagged and canned milk powder are exactly the same, with no difference at all.
So everyone must be wondering: Why is the shelf life of bagged products one year, while the shelf life of canned products is two years or longer?
Or another question: Why is there such a big price difference between canned and bagged products?
In fact, starting from this point, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, it's just that everyone thinks that the more expensive ones are better.
Some consumers also have this mentality, and after eating, they react and say that the taste or flavor of the imitation product is just different!
Now let me first tell you the reason for listening to expensive equipment, where is the expensive part?
Why is there such a big price difference when their raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers take into account that if the price of bagged products is set too high, consumers will find it difficult to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturers are very low, or there is no profit at all. So, what do manufacturers rely on to survive?
Therefore, they have a large increase in the pricing of the listening devices to ensure their profit margin.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly promote canned products, rather than bagged ones.
There are also manufacturers you think of that spend tens of millions or even billions of advertising fees every year. Where does this cost come from?
As everyone can imagine.
So with the development of society, the market promotion expenses, such as: shopping mall promoters, shopping mall display fees, product gift expenses, advertising expenses, etc., are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are constantly adding new products, and they are listening to the installation, and the prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these new products are emerging with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, resort to any means necessary, collaborating with doctors in hospitals to assist in product promotion, and making profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan per sale.
But the relevant laws in China absolutely do not allow such methods of operation, and in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
I suggest that everyone buy bagged milk powder and put it into a container at home, so as to save costs and improve the preservation and sealing of the milk powder, without any impact on the children.
Also, don't think that the shelf life of canned products is longer than that of bagged ones. After opening, the shelf life of canned and bagged products is the same. It's just that bagged products are not easy to store after opening and are prone to moisture and spoilage.
The food delivery was late, the food got cold, and after it got cold, it became dry and hard, making it completely inedible.
And the soup spilled out.

Don't scare people off at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When browsing the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success-study books.
Nowadays, many success books advocate the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "achieve it", and then tell you "what" you need to achieve.
In other words, it skipped the "how to achieve" part, which is actually the most important and fundamental link.
Precisely because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - either do your best in one go, or simply don't do anything at all; either it's 100, or it's 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people will be scared off before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make up your mind, start anew, and make a 180-degree change," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who stick to conventions, follow old practices, and refuse to change, shouting "you need to transform" in their ears is undoubtedly self-deception and like playing the lute to a cow.
The vast majority of people will show fear in the face of "change," hesitating to move forward and struggling to make up their minds; or they may make the decision to "change" impulsively and bravely take the first step, but often the good times don't last long, and they can't persist for much longer before they are defeated, making it difficult to see any continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most vivid expression of this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "sigh with admiration at the door."
Perhaps, the "second best principle" is a way that may allow more ordinary people to embark on the path of relative success.
The core of the "next best principle" lies in "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories for a big win", that is, if you can't achieve 100, it's okay to achieve only 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to climb the small sand dune at your doorstep, because that's still better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it has become more possible for ordinary people to persist, and as long as one persists in anything, the probability of success will also increase.
The only difference is that the path to success following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" appears to promote success for everyone on the surface, it actually only motivates a minority; the "second-best principle", on the other hand, can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increase by 0.71 thousand tons this year - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) - Reporters learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 thousand tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108.5 thousand tons. Compared with the initial stage of protection in 2002, the cumulative growth is more than 40 times.
Qinghai Lake naked carp, commonly known as "Huang fish", is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the increasingly deteriorating environment of the naked carp's breeding waters, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Species Red List".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented lake closure for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective, and individual from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and banning the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and stocking, cleaning the main river channels entering Qinghai Lake, and designing scientifically reasonable "fish passages" and other measures, the protection efforts have been continuously increased, and the reserves of Qinghai Lake naked carp have been increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up to now, nearly 180 million artificially propagated and released naked carp have been implemented in Qinghai Lake, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Sanjiangyuan region in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and Qinghai Lake waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued fishing ban notices for the key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, establishing a comprehensive fishing ban management system for "one river, one river, one lake."

Just saw an article about menstruation, it's too long.
To popularize some knowledge for men who don't know.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period one day during the ages of 13-15, and menopause occurs around the age of 50.
Afterwards, under the premise of good health, it will come regularly every month.
But it's not accurate enough to make precise predictions, with a tolerance of about a week, so you need to prepare in advance. Sometimes, if you're unlucky, things can go wrong (suddenly moving up several days).
The duration, blood volume, and degree of menstrual pain vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, while others have it for a week; some people have a light flow, while others have a heavy flow; some people have no reaction, while others are in so much pain that they need to be taken away by an ambulance. Menstrual pain can change over time, and not having pain in the past doesn't mean you won't have pain for the rest of your life.
Menstruation cannot be controlled, and it bleeds 24 hours a day for several days from the beginning to the end. The only thing that can be done is to use sanitary pads or tampons to absorb the blood and prevent it from flowing onto clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins. Taking ibuprofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period, before the pain starts, can effectively relieve the pain for that month. Taking it after the pain has started is not very useful.
Before menstruation, due to congestion of the uterus and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it's about time for the cycle, and you suddenly have diarrhea, your period will usually come within two days.
Sanitary pads should be changed every two to three hours, otherwise bacteria can easily breed. Excluding sleep time, the worst-case scenario is changing 6 times a day, 7 days a month, which is 42 pads. If you add the extra pads prepared in advance, there might be 50 pads, and it's not just one pad used per month.
(Here's a modification, sanitary tampons don't need to be changed frequently, about every five to six hours is fine, and the longest is eight hours)
During menstruation, hormones may cause irritability, and emotional instability may occur during ovulation due to hormonal changes in the body. It's very unlucky, as the body trips itself up.
However, official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.

After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is like a house, building a house (thickening the endometrium) every month to welcome guests. If the guests do not come, everything is dismantled (menstruation is discharged), and a new house is built next month, repeating the cycle.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades, bleeding 24 hours a day for a few days every month, and also experiencing abdominal pain and back pain. Who would want that?
But people are born because their mothers have had menstruation, which is to prepare the house where you will live for 10 months when you first come to this world. Everyone should be grateful to their mothers for having regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things related to women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women into thinking they were dirty and shameful. Everyone thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone finds menstruation disgusting and thinks that the preparation of a woman's body for nurturing life is disgusting, they shouldn't say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think like this anymore. Men who have never experienced it and will never experience it in their lives, and who don't understand it well, should not be so ungrateful and ignorant. How can they face their own mothers with such an attitude, and how can they even think about wanting their own children?
Finally, sisters, try using tampons, they are really useful.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival, sending the wrong gift is quite disappointing.
Need to order additional meals for the children
Hope the shop can check the products in the midst of their busy schedule.
Is the foot numbness caused by soaking in the foot bath due to an electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can have a good foot therapy health care effect. Today, Guomei's editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the increasing awareness of health care, foot baths are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different grades have emerged in the market. Foot baths ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan are available, providing consumers with a great deal of choice.
On the surface of relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming, but there is no specific industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking your feet in electrified water is really too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath tub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness on the soles of his feet while soaking them.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet.

Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there are no clear and detailed industry regulations for this long-popular foot bath in terms of the highest temperature setting, the target population, and the type of materials to ensure harmlessness.
But generally speaking, foot bath tubs do not have electrical issues, although it cannot be ruled out that a few products may not have been strictly checked during production.
Therefore, choose a split-type foot bath tub when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can casually take the electric pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10th news (all-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint towards the 100 billion tea industry goal.
Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Hou Shunli, and Deputy Director of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Ye Hongzhuan, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Red is in Xinhua, and the rise of black tea injects new vitality into the "Colorful Hunan Tea."
In recent years, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a 100-billion-yuan Hunan tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, and Five Colored Teas."
The tea industry in the province is increasing innovation, with the main tea categories such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert their strength. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea and tourism, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase their income.
The wheel of fortune turns, and black tea regains its strength.
Experts in the local tea industry say that after picking green tea, picking red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens rises straight.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua proudly held the "Source of Hunan Red Tea".
At the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant took a fancy to a high-mountain tea called "Spring in Ice" and placed an order on the spot.
Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the perspective of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xinhua black tea adds a touch of red, incorporating the connotation of tea culture, enjoying high popularity and brisk trading, the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it anymore, because there is no place to park below, he couldn't deliver it up here.
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through perception by means of rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" comes from the phrase "形而上者谓之道，形而下者谓之器" in "Yijing: Xici Shang," which was translated from the word "metaphysic" by Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro during the Meiji era.
Metaphysics branches include ontology, natural theology, and related issues.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existing entities and which nouns only represent a concept.
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
The theoretical basis holds that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reasons, proposed by philosophers who support science and the theory of evolution.
The methodological naturalism refers to the research method that does not mention God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all behavioral norms recognized by a group of people or a culture.
The main divisions are meta-ethics (abstractly studying the nature of ethical theories or critiques), and normative ethics (evaluating various moral views and providing moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies the moral behavior guidelines that people should follow, applied ethics (the academic application of ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information on how people live, and making conclusions from observed patterns).
It examines ethics not from a preconceived theoretical perspective, but by investigating the actual choices made by real moral agents and the moral factors that contribute to these decisions, and it discusses the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, and medieval Christian ethics.
Part One: Humanistic ethical thought, represented by Valla and Montaigne, among others.
Part Two: The ethical thought of the religious reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part Three: Political Ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British Empiricist ethics, represented by Hume and others, 17-18th century, Continental Rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza and others, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire and others, 18-19th century, German Academic ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel and others, 18-19th century, British Utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick and others, 19th century, British Evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley and others, late 19th century, German Neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Rickert and others, late 19th century, Neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green and others), transitional ethics (Irrationalist ethics, represented by Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche and others).
Logic is a discipline that studies "the principles and standards of valid inference and proof."
Logic usually consists of three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline that focuses on the study of the nature and significance of beauty.

I just don't want to go downstairs to buy things, that's why I spend so much money on takeout.
Ding Zilin: To my friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all friends for their humanitarian assistance during the more than 30 years since our family members encountered misfortune. Especially since I issued a personal appeal for humanitarian aid to friends at home and abroad in early 1994, the assistance has never been interrupted up to now.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, started families, and found jobs.
It is your righteous actions that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult times.
At present, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging across the globe, and most of the donors have already reached retirement age.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to stop providing humanitarian donations to our difficult group - the Tiananmen Mothers, as this humanitarian aid activity should have already come to a perfect end.
I will always cherish your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be recorded in history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please forgive me, friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye'an: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
During the process of humanitarian aid, the All-American Students Association and the Minnesota Chinese Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often overlap.
(Apple Daily Picture: Tiananmen Mothers website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Relief funds often cannot be smoothly delivered to the hands of the families of the June 4th incident victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was formed by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the "June 4th Orphans Education Fund". After 11 years of implementation, in 2009, when all the June 4th orphans had graduated from college, MCDF then established the "June 4th Impoverished Elderly Special Assistance Fund" and has been implementing it ever since.
The funding for these projects mainly comes from campus and social donations during the June 4th incident, generous individual contributions, and is supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Reform Research Foundation.
Until last year, 31 years later, the families of the June 4th victims finally received a portion of the donations raised in the name of June 4th from Hong Kong.
During this period, "China Human Rights" is also independently implementing their humanitarian aid projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called a halt to the June 4th donations, considering the donors. Indeed, we are all retired elderly people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude for Teacher Ding's letter "To Friends."
We will respect the decision of the bereaved families, terminate this project within two years, and resume it immediately when needed.
To those chivalrous comrades who have been generously donating and risking their lives to deliver humanitarian aid for many years, I express my gratitude and respect.

Thank you very much for choosing our product. Before using our chip, please take 5 minutes to carefully read the following content:
After opening the box, please check if the goods are complete.
If there is any shortage, please contact customer service in time.
The cover plate of the microfluidic chip is made of PC material, please do not introduce solvents that cause chemical reactions with PC.

Member Evaluation
[Effect] Photo effect: Took pictures of two outfits, overall it's not bad, I prefer this set in the picture~
[Service] Service details: Because I felt a little uncomfortable while putting on makeup due to pregnancy, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate, allowing me to rest for a while on the side and constantly pouring me hot water to drink.
Set price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally, I said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style. I didn't expect the finished product to be simply too beautiful.
Thank you for Dandan's recognition. Your satisfaction can energize us to keep moving forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really awesome, highly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, everything is impeccable.
The makeup artist is especially meticulous and will match a makeup look suitable for you based on your style. The cosmetics used are all top-tier brands.
As for Teacher Tian Liang, there's no need to mention that his photography skills are quite professional.
The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two kittens to accompany and play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing require a six-month advance reservation. A colleague had their photos taken in Beijing, and after looking at the finished product, I felt it was just so-so.
Specially sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and we feel that this is also a shortcoming for most people. Photographer Liang Ge is good at capturing and recording natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-crafted team.
The finished product has received endless praise from us and the people around us.
Already recommended my best friend to go there, and she just looked at the negatives and was equally overjoyed.
I hope that such studios will not be buried, and more people will discover them, creating their own style instead of being stereotyped.
Thank you very much for Zhan Ying and Jing Ling's five-star reviews. Both of you are very thoughtful and creative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and as long as the customers like it, we will do our best to complete it with 200% effort. Grateful for the encounter and meeting.
Sweet and considerate assistant, and lively and cheerful photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting experience and an unforgettable experience. Moreover, the shooting effect is much better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, and I am very grateful to all of you 😘😘
Thank you for Xiaoyu's comments. It's a kind of fate to know you all. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust in us is as much as thousands of kilometers of journey. I am very happy to know you. If there is a chance, come to Qinhuangdao again next time.
How do I give money?

The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming newbie who wants to share their personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with extremely weak self-discipline, training is an even better choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter.
First of all, we need to look at the teaching strength of this institution. If the teaching strength is not strong enough, there is no point in this training institution. Of course, the teaching strength of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Next, before making a choice, inquire about the training institution, and it's best to find out about the students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how good it is and whether the courses taught are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because you didn't provide any introduction about your own situation, and learning has a lot to do with one's personal situation.
For example, profession, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these are related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or a computer science major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, as this is the most efficient and cost-effective method. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situations I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online, or you can find a lot of training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can afford a certain amount of learning costs and time, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. This way, learning is not very difficult, the teacher's explanation is also very detailed, and there are people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, it is helpful in terms of learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after their studies, which can save a lot of trouble in the interview process when looking for a job later on.
The above are some of my opinions. As I mentioned earlier, I don't know your situation, so I can only provide a general introduction and not in detail. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, I saw it all on the App.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking, what are you doing?
I undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance) services for wall-mounted boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, range hoods, light fixture installation, glass cleaning, professional seam beautification, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently give me likes. Struggling for life, life is tiring but we must continue.
Life will not disappoint every hardworking person, if you like, please follow me, and thank those who silently give me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, we bear the process alone, facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue, we can look back on the road but cannot go back...
Cleaning is work, and it is also a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful because of service, and service becomes brilliant because of dedication.
Although we do the dirtiest work in cleaning, we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most serious attitude, and when we see the satisfied smile and thumbs up from the customer, all the tiredness is worth it, and the effort will eventually be rewarded!
My daily work
— Your request, my service.
Serve with heart, clean with heart, keep the beauty.
The details you care about, Fenggui Housekeeping helps you achieve "cleanliness" to the best of our ability, serving your beloved home.
Protect the cleanliness of ten thousand homes, establish a household management monument, provide on-point service, and bring cleanliness to every home.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although crystal lamps are gorgeous, they will become dull and lackluster if not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, and so it is with life.
Only by working diligently can we achieve success, by paying attention to details can we create refinement, and we take the beauty seam seriously.
Give me a chance, I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's difficult to do any job nowadays!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough persistence, and enough effort, I will be better than others, at least better than sitting and complaining!
A day's plan starts in the morning, and all the beauty begins in the early morning. I hope you set out with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction to start a new day and maintain a good mood all day. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was a thing, and having it meant happiness; when we grew up, happiness became a goal, and achieving it meant happiness; after maturing, we realized that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it brings happiness.
Be the most genuine and kind-hearted self, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life; there is only one path in life, walk your own path; there are two treasures in life: good health and a good mood, live beautifully and gracefully until old age!
At every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face things positively.
Since it's impossible to avoid, it's better to face it calmly.
The more you fear, the more you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face difficulties head on, problems will eventually be solved.
Curators from Zhongsha join hands to hold Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) - The first Saudi Arabian contemporary art biennale - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating in the exhibition.
This Biennale is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, with the director of the Chinese UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Tian Feiyu, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this Biennale is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which metaphorically represents the reform strategy adopted during the social and economic transition period, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society's cultural development.
This Biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Touching the Stones," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Approaching the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in "The Endless Landscape Behind the Story Series" (2014), reconstructing a classic landscape painting with waste materials.
Diriyah Biennale Foundation CEO Buckley said that he hopes this Biennale can establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to have the opportunity to understand the thriving cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction and exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the Biennale is twofold, both to enable Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that during the Biennale opening period, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) - In order to continuously do a good job in helping the impoverished population find employment and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the management of public welfare positions for promoting rural revitalization, helping to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
A person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to provide employment for poverty alleviation labor and other rural disadvantaged groups. This plays an important role in helping impoverished people achieve employment and increase income, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the capabilities of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc., mainly standardizing the scope of target candidates, fund management, job development, and job management for the recruitment of public welfare positions in rural grassroots.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations clearly state that the establishment should be carried out according to the principles of "setting positions according to demand, determining personnel by positions, dynamic management, and total control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible", and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, public notification, employment, pre-job training, and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments for rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and stipulate that each rural public welfare position development department should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for the personnel placed in rural public welfare positions; it also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the issuance of subsidies for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can the order be cancelled?
I will place the order again
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the rightists have had their moments of success in history, they were short-lived. The reason for their brevity is that they flourish with just a little sunshine and sweat with just a sip of water; they become greedy when they achieve a little success, and when they encounter setbacks, they cling to whoever is in power.
But to be objective, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the rightists in defining the criteria for truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and technological advancement, as well as promoting the institutionalization of the political system and the protection of human rights, should not be denied.
3. As for me, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's opinions, I do care about what he says and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that opposing the necessary revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and a mix of good and bad political groups. Moreover, it will create an opportunity for foreign forces to take advantage of the situation.
4. To change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to take advantage of the situation are not right-wingers, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left side again.
Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left doesn't have this fortune, because what the left wants is precisely the dregs that the Communist Party has discarded!
5. Recently, I saw some friends arguing with anti-rebels and refuting the left-wing crazies, and they were quite serious about it. I think it's not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors and left-wing lunatics, they are all stubborn and unreasonable.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the rebels and the leftists admit it. What's the point?
I tell my friends this: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent, and the leftists call you a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle path is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they either forget their ideals or pursue them, only to become obsessed.
Gradually drifting away from ideals, even the young dragon slayer eventually becomes an evil dragon.
Left and right, I think, generally refer to constraints and freedom. Due to China's inherent historical and cultural genes, China as a whole should lean to the left.
The domestic right-wing advocates for freedom, focusing on efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes stronger regulation, paying more attention to fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time, with the competition between China and the United States, leaning to the left is certain, and it is estimated that this will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, just like it and it's done.
No more words, Hua Hua is just so righteous.
In the past two years, the US blockade and encirclement of Huawei's chips have not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament but also caused huge losses for "American" companies.
The US suppresses China's chip industry, requiring its own companies and allied countries' related companies to simultaneously block our country's chip industry. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in a reduction in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturing enterprises, thereby causing a shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Nowadays, the "chip shortage" has affected major industries worldwide, such as car companies halting production and mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to gain control of "chip" autonomy, more and more technology giants from various countries are moving towards the path of "de-Americanization."
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor dominance and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the United States has recently taken frequent actions, such as hosting the "Chip Summit"; inviting 64 countries' giants to establish a semiconductor alliance, and providing financial support to American domestic technology giants. For example, the veteran American technology giant Intel, in order to regain its leading position in the chip field, invested 20 billion US dollars to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, and opened up chip foundry services to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC and may very likely take away TSMC's "rice bowl."
The reason for such certainty is that, as an old American technology giant, Intel has been deeply involved in the semiconductor field for decades, possessing a large talent pool and technical reserves, and is bound to rise rapidly in the short term, defeating TSMC.
However, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou dismisses Intel's decision with disdain.
At the "2021 Masters Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a startling statement. Regarding Intel's investment in building a wafer fab, Zhang Zhongmou bluntly said: Intel building a chip foundry is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou looks down on Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou still bears a grudge against the grievances between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the jewel in the crown of American manufacturing, occupying the top position globally and dominating the world semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had always been controlled by a few strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, with chip design, manufacturing, and packaging all done by one factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model is unbearable for some small businesses, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred by the huge costs of production line construction.
Under the influence of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to show the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were specialized design companies, a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Not long after, Zhang Zhongmou's vision became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC focuses its main business on the single link of "wafer processing", not engaging in design, and only providing foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, the newly established TSMC was just a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but at that time, Intel looked down on TSMC when they heard that TSMC only focused on the manufacturing segment of the chip industry, and they obviously had a high opinion of themselves. As a result, Intel decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel looked down on wafer manufacturing services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who once looked down on wafer manufacturing services now have to start doing wafer foundry work.
So, Zhang Zhongmou finds it ironic that Intel is entering the foundry business.
Nowadays, TSMC's market value has already surpassed Intel.
Facing TSMC's strong offensive, Intel naturally dares not to stand still and be complacent.
Nowadays, TSMC is sprinting towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at the 14nm level from 7 years ago.
Catching up is actually not easy.
Not waiting anymore
Ordered at 19:06, it's been 2 hours now😅
Today, let's take a look at some [strange trending searches].
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly selected three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Raising its Head, Haoliyou price increase, Lalamove incident, public opinion spread forming a peak, and then the [index declines] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates, if secondary public opinion occurs, a small peak will appear again.
They look no different from the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selected six hot searches from the same event, showing a 【solitary peak】, 【sawtooth】, and 【cliff-like】 pattern.
"Solitary peak" refers to artificially heating up a topic, quickly making it a hot search, and attracting public attention; "sawtooth" refers to periodically heating up a topic, ensuring that it stays on the hot search list; "cliff" refers to collectively withdrawing from a hot search after it has fulfilled its "function", receiving new tasks, and moving on to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, with no difference in time. It must be the same batch of water army receiving the task and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, some attract attention, some are responsible for popularizing science, some provoke fights and create momentum, some divert attention, some influence cognition, some mislead judgment, some incite emotions, and some involve decision-making. Black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes for refined operations, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Setting aside positions, emotions, and all subjective factors, and only focusing on objective data, negative public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Wherever we go, we leave traces behind. Let's dig out these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries report first cases of Omicron variant infection - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 - Comprehensive reports from Xinhua News Agency's foreign correspondents: Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omicron variant infections on the 10th.
According to Mauritius Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for the virus on November 30 after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the nucleic acid test results of these two infected persons have turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
Cyprus's Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first 3 cases of Omicron variant infections.
These 3 people are all students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. Since they all have mild symptoms, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government of Seychelles continues to strengthen its prevention and control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above entering the country by plane will need to pay for nucleic acid testing at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi's Health Minister Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda said on the 9th that the country has detected its first three cases of Omicron variant infections.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing on 12 COVID-positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found these 3 infection cases.

Received is money belly
Order is chicken feet
Alright, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called and explained to your staff.
Your rider told me that the address is too far away.
Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happy Home, No. 156 Huan Cheng South Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look. Initially, my budget was 70,000 for basic decoration.
Upon arriving at the store, a series of scams began.
I visited the store for the first time and just showed them my floor plan. They didn't actually go to measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000. They roughly showed me their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were using.
Their second trick is that as long as you go to the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay this money, you can never get it back, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that as long as you pay the deposit today, they can give you a certain discount.
This is a big pitfall, and I am a living example of being deceived. In a moment of impulsive thinking, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
There are many issues with the quote he gave me. 70,000 does not include water and electricity renovations, nor does it include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, and these three are the main costs of basic decoration.
Except for these, the service fees they charge are also higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company, they didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and just asked me to sign the contract.
When I went to ask for a refund, they seemed very experienced, with a dedicated small team to deal with you.
No matter what, it's the customer's problem that they will bite to death, and they are completely blameless.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and there are many details, I don't want to say one by one, all are tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house renovated by them is also of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
What a rip-off, they were originally the deceptive leader in dragon head decorations, now they've changed to Da Mei, and it seems like they've gone bankrupt and changed to something else again.
So everyone, don't choose such a pitfall decoration company.
In the future, everyone should use Baidu more when making choices, and look up these consultations because renovation is not a small expense.
To ask questions to the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit posting reviews of businesses in any form, for details please refer to the business inclusion statement.
Dianping's Kunming decoration design channel provides you with the latest business information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of DAMEI 360 Integrated Home Decoration. For decoration companies, visit Dianping.
So scary, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there really no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, then don't cancel this conversation. If I don't receive a refund in 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue the matter.
I asked if it can be canceled within less than 15 minutes.
The saliva chicken should be cooked, but I received raw meat, which is inedible.
Starry Sky Appointment | Geminid Meteor Shower Peaks on the 14th - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) - Astronomy popular science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, the Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak on December 14. Friends who like meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the night on that day.
Beijing astronomy enthusiast An Jiu photographed the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2018, in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers have periodic comets as their parent bodies, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is the 3200 Phaethon, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Gemini meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower that is not "bred" by a comet.
Tianjin Astronomical Society director and astronomy popularization expert Xiu Lipeng said that, just like a New Year's blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year, with the "screening period" lasting from December 4th to 17th.
This meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and together with the Quadrantids meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower, they are called the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere.
A notable feature of the Gemini meteor shower is that the meteors have relatively slow speeds, rich colors, and many fire meteors, making it suitable for both visual observation and for beginners in astrophotography to capture.
Tianjin amateur astronomer Yang Jing photographed the Geminid meteor shower on December 13, 2020, in Jizhou, Tianjin.
The astronomical forecast shows that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak at around 15:00 on December 14th, with a maximum ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour under ideal observation conditions, when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150.
Gemini meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'colorful falling petals' of the Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by moonlight, and the spectacular level will be slightly discounted."
On the 14th, it is the eleventh day of the eleventh lunar month, and the moon phase is a gibbous moon. The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, but fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower will also rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe them in the few hours after the moon sets in the latter half of the night, but be sure to keep warm and protect against the cold.
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"Not recommended for observation in the city, you can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution, and facing the northeast direction in the suburbs or countryside, and then patiently wait until the moon sets, and you can observe with the naked eye."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and there is no need to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower during observation.
Photography enthusiasts who want to capture stunning 'meteor shower shots' should choose wide-angle, large-aperture lenses, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries, and shutter cables are also essential. "
Xiulipeng reminds.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
Based on my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the questioner should refer to the LCD TV, and the differences in market positioning between laser TV and LCD TV mainly include the following two points:
First, laser TVs are more focused on the big screen market.
Compared to the widespread market positioning of LCD TVs, laser TVs are obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or it can be said that laser TVs are inherently products born for large screens.
At present, the mainstream LCD TV sizes are mostly between 55 inches and 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the users' demand for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs have been continuously increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of 80-inch and larger TVs.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good results in the big screen market is mainly due to the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser television, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight emission of liquid crystal television, the imaging process is closer to the natural imaging process of objects, and the stimulation to the eyes is also smaller.
China Electronics Standardization Institute's Saixi Laboratory and Beijing Union Hospital's ophthalmology experts conducted a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TVs and LCD TVs under the same conditions for the population, obtaining 144 sets of test data.
Data confirms: Laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection features, and even have certain improvement effects in specific aspects.
In the context of increasing attention to vision health, laser TVs not only attract more and more users with their eye protection advantages, but also open up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TVs are more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, the current market price of laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price gradually increases.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
Relying on ultra-short throw projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is relatively shorter compared to traditional projection equipment, allowing for a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. The required space is not large, and the main unit is compact, occupying a small area.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can achieve over 2000 lumens.
In addition, the lower heat generation results in less wear and tear on the equipment, and the TV has a longer service life.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with true 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, bionic screens, and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not a false demand, but a product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not suitable for audio-visual enthusiasts. If you want to balance a large screen and insufficient viewing environment, you can try it. Everything has its pros and cons, just weigh them and make your own judgment. The problem is believing only one side of the story.
In simple terms, ultra-wide-angle short-throw projectors - laser TVs, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors in order to be close to the screen, which does not conform to the optimal optical design.
In order to block some ambient light, using a microstructured Fresnel screen is expensive, and the price of an 80-inch screen can basically be exchanged for a 65-inch LCD.
There's another thing, I particularly hate projector manufacturers using diffuse reflection being good for the eyes as a selling point. Please, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes. If you diffuse the light to the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. If you really want to argue, LCD TVs are also diffuse "direct light." When you turn on the TV, isn't the ceiling also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse reflection, it cannot form an image at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen that is overlooked, where a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes at a certain angle, which is truly uncomfortable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Preferred Quality Store, temporarily no branches available.
After adding WeChat to make an appointment, the young lady sent me the available time slots, and her response was quite prompt~
Before going, I looked at the shooting works in the store, most of which were outdoor wedding dresses, which were very beautiful, and involved a variety of shooting styles.
After arriving that day, I briefly communicated my thoughts with the young lady, and she patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes in the styles I was struggling with. Finally, we settled on the makeup and styling~ Before the photographer started shooting, they would arrange some props, guide the movements, and pay close attention to every detail, striving for perfection.
But maybe because there was no communication with me about the specific shooting ideas, the result is not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking🙊🙊
After taking the photos, the photographer will help choose the pictures, discuss the post-production style, and they seem quite attentive.
The repaired film will take about half a month, just wait for the results~
Won the free photo shoot event for the second time~ Most of the clothes in the venue can be chosen for the shoot.
Finally chose a black gauze skirt to experience a different style.
The entire shooting process takes about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge is a younger brother born after 1995, who feels a bit inexperienced. I hope he can provide more guidance on the customers' shooting poses in the future~ He is quite talkative, and the shooting process is quite enjoyable.
Wen She Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Preferred Quality Store Reply
Visited the homepage, come take a look at Queenie too~
Upon arrival at the store, I filled in my name and phone number, then chose the clothing. Wedding dresses were also available for selection. I tried on three or four outfits, and they were quite patient. After making my choice, the makeup took a long time, but the service attitude was good. During the photoshoot, they taught me how to pose. However, my face looked quite big in the photos. They said the retouching would take half a month, but it was sent to me in just three or four days. It seemed like there was not much difference between the retouched and original photos.
[Environment] Overall, it's not bad.
There are many clothes to choose from.
There are about three makeup stations, and inside is the photo studio.
[Service] Very enthusiastic, and very attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also teach you the poses very seriously.
Not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to propose a reshoot.
[Experience] The styling might have gone a bit too far, the original double eyelids were taped into triple eyelids.
The ends of the eyebrows were also shaved, which is a bit awkward for those who don't draw their eyebrows daily.
The photos were given more than ten days ago, but I'm not very satisfied with the Photoshop effect. I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still very obvious.
Because I was not sure about the style, I tried two sets. After choosing back and forth, I finally picked the black dress. The girl said this set is more of an Audrey Hepburn vintage style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my makeup and hair. The hairstylist and makeup artist were both super patient in helping me, and I was very satisfied with the results.
After finishing my makeup and hair, I started taking photos. The photographer guided me on how to pose throughout the whole process, and it was very relaxed and harmonious.
After taking the photos, I carefully selected four of my favorites for retouching. The guy said they would be ready within 15 days. In the end, I was very satisfied with the results.
Already 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is, I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I have to pay shipping fees every time now.
Can you waive the fee first, and then charge me the monthly fee after you finish the investigation? Is that okay?
Buy insurance for a small umbrella, is it reliable?
Little Umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the "Insurance Brokerage Supervision Regulations (Revised in 2015)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three keywords must be met: shareholders, initiators with no major violations in the past 3 years, a minimum limit of RMB 50 million is required to establish, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually quite stringent. In summary, a company must have strength, be approved by the national authoritative department of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which regulates domestic insurance companies and banks), and have shareholders with a good work style. As for Xiaoyusan Insurance, an insurance brokerage company, policyholders do not need to question whether Xiaoyusan Insurance is legitimate or not, as not every insurance company can meet these three thresholds.
At this point, it's not bad and is trustworthy.
Looking at insurance products: Xiaoyusan Insurance is an insurance supermarket, where many companies' star critical illness insurance products are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mario No. 5 critical illness insurance. Both the claimant and the insurer are Hetai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyusan Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the reduced operating costs of business outlets and the cost of sales staff salaries, generally have a higher cost-performance ratio. Moreover, the payment methods are flexible, supporting monthly payments, which can alleviate the payment pressure on policyholders and maximize the leverage of insurance.
This point is still quite good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of professional competence of salespersons: This point is particularly important because insurance is an industry with very high professional requirements. Many internet product customers can insure themselves, which can lead to many misunderstandings. In terms of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when applying for insurance, thinking that they are healthy or suitable. This can easily lead to many hidden risks in claims and the possibility of being denied compensation.
I once worked as an insurance telemarketer at "Tencent WeBao" (like Little Umbrella, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I am very responsible in telling everyone this.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, but the unreliable factor is people. There are no professional practitioners in the Internet channel, and there are many sales misguidances.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance and get a mobile phone, receive 60,000 critical illness coverage for free, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but they avoid the important and focus on the trivial, and do not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, and the following month requires normal charges, ranging from tens to 200, many customers are unclear about what they have bought after being charged for one or two years.
Thought you could spend 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (pies falling from the sky).
Free mobile phone giveaway is for special policy numbers ending in 6666, 8888, etc. Moreover, if the winning text message is sent out and you don't redeem it, no one will remind you.
(For the insured, this is another pitfall) Getting 60,000 yuan of critical illness coverage for free is short-term. If you only rely on this and have no other commercial insurance, in case a critical illness really occurs, what can 60,000 yuan do? It can't solve the problem, and your future life will start naked running.
At present, the country is also cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
Therefore, in summary, there is no problem with the platform, and there is no problem with the product. The problem lies in the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesperson.
I suggest the questioner to consider comprehensively and cautiously. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products also have a better cost-performance ratio than internet products.
I have personally helped 59 internet customers, underwriting offline products, saving each person 2000-3000 yuan/year in premiums.
If you have any questions, feel free to communicate and exchange ideas with me.
I: Mingya insurance broker, with 3 years of corporate management training experience, have served nearly a thousand corporate users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before taking out insurance, I will start from the customer's needs and tailor insurance products for the customer. During the insurance process, I will compare three companies for the customer, striving for the best underwriting results for the customer. After taking out insurance, I will organize and manage the insurance policies for the customer, allowing them to feel at ease and worry-free.
Grow together with each customer for a lifetime.
I hope my answer can be helpful to the questioner!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business where the policyholder can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign either, and all steps can be completed independently by the policyholder.
Although the process of purchasing insurance online may lack a sense of "ceremony" and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing," but there is a fatal problem with buying insurance in this way, which is that the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for a long time and provide us with services many years later?
How can I contact the delivery staff?
It's already almost 3 o'clock.
So do I get compensation?
I said to knock on the door for delivery
But the rider just left it at the door, and then the person left.
Still delivered wrongly
Your rider has already picked up my takeaway at #NUMBER#, but it still shows as waiting now.

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must put an end to such scoundrels.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
Since you started sending me Facebook friend requests, then posting sarcastic posts, and even trying to publish the so-called location of my home and my father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you not only continued to tag me at a rate of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, body shape, fertility, and comments about planting strawberries in bed and whether to insert or not. I... let it go.
How would I know that later on, I would receive messages from several friends about your Facebook account uploading a photo of you and making sexually harassing comments.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't restrain yourself at all, but instead became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your identity and status; in our society, mutual respect between the sexes is required.
Yes, you can continue with this sarcastic, obscure, humiliating, and insulting language, you can also continue to say that you are just caring and concerned about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that the picture was not made by you or continue to make all kinds of aggressive statements.
That's right, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you all.
I neither know you nor want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need your comments and judgments.
I don't even think there would be any girl willing to let others humiliate her like this in exchange for fame.
A friend asked me, are you okay?
I said it's fine, but you won't believe me.
I don't think there is any girl who can say she's fine after being bullied like this.
No matter in work, society, politics, or business, only those who lack even basic morals would choose to hurt any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of people.
I have taken a screenshot of some comments for everyone to judge.
No one should be able to impersonate you in the posts you send yourself, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.

Vietnam People's Daily Online - Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the Third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held, with discussions focusing on two main themes: digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Communications and Media Nguyen Manh Hung said that in 2021, despite the continuous spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number and revenue of Vietnamese digital technology companies still maintained a growth momentum, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, the number of typical digital products in Vietnam has increased, focusing on solving major problems faced by Vietnam. Many digital products have gone abroad, and Vietnam's digital technology ranking has improved.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong called on digital technology companies to take responsibility for developing national digital transformation platforms, and to undertake the task of developing these countries' digital platforms as a national mission.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and national agencies, as well as enterprises, organizations, and individuals engaged in research, development, application, and transfer of digital technologies, shared their breakthrough ideas and solutions for mobilizing and pooling resources from the whole society to develop Vietnamese technology companies, jointly promoting the country's digital transformation, and post-pandemic economic recovery.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized in his speech at the forum that digital transformation is an inevitable path for the world and an objective need for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, serving the whole population, so it is necessary to mobilize the participation of all people.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and enterprises.
Premier Fan Mingzheng emphasized that digital transformation needs to reflect the national spirit, and should be based on internal strength as the main, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, with external forces as important and breakthrough points.
He also believes that digital transformation needs to drive in-depth and sustainable development, participate in COVID-19 prevention and control, economic recovery and development, respond to subsequent changes, overcome the depletion of natural resources, and promote green transformation and the development of green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national customs and other database construction work, and promote the digital transformation of banks, taxation, land management and development databases, as well as logistics and other fields.
The ultimate goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country increasingly prosperous and developed.
Premier Fan Mingzheng demands that governments at all levels, institutions, and enterprises increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, enhance their understanding of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises with a spirit of respect, communication, listening, positivity, and initiative.
During the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the 2021 "Made in Vietnam" Outstanding Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the "Made in Vietnam" Digital Product Exhibition.

The home appliances here are quite complete, with numerous brands and all well-known brands available.
During Double Twelve, I went to the "Hansdun" water purifier store to look at water purifiers. The store was having a promotion, and the prices were relatively favorable.
Home of Surprises has a total of 11 floors, from basement level 2 to the 9th floor. Basement levels 1 and 2 are parking areas, and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are not very impressive, with only a few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the food in the restaurants is just average.
This elevator is also speechless, like having a serious illness, going back and forth from negative two to negative one, constantly pressing this floor, going down to the first floor from the safety passage, also speechless, directly leading to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and can't get out through the safety passage!
Home of the Unexpected still needs improvement, and many areas have not been developed.
Address: No. 555 GaoTie North 1st Road, Shayibake District, with convenient transportation and a large parking lot, which is free during the day.
Environment: To be honest, the store is quite large, with 8-9 floors. You can buy all kinds of furniture, household appliances, and various small items that you want for your home.

The main stream of the Yangtze River achieves full coverage of green integrated service areas on the water - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xian) - The Fuling Waterborne Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second waterborne green integrated service area officially operating in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, following the inauguration of the Luzhou Waterborne Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province on the 8th.
Up to now, the waterborne green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Deputy Director Qiu Jianhua of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Transport introduced that previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have built and operated 10 waterborne green integrated service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of crew members and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of green integrated service areas on water is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, and the reception of pollutants from ships and the shipping service capacity have been significantly improved.
According to the introduction, the waterborne green integrated service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to a wide range of ships and crew members, helping them solve "urgent, difficult, worried, and hopeful" problems.
The two newly built and operational green integrated service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River combine living services, production services, and government services, with the theme of green environmental protection and the features of ship maintenance and emergency rescue services. They enable ships in the port to "dock once and receive multiple services," making the work of crew members sailing on the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam 2022-01-17 Duowei Pro-China media Duowei reports: The latest news on China-US relations: The latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China; US media also revealed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam, sending important signals to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the Chinese think tank "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform", on January 9, a satellite discovered the US aircraft carrier "USS Carl Vinson" near the Balabac Strait.
The Balabac Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain of the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that the "Carl Vinson" will be deployed to the South China Sea.
This is the first time the "Carl Vinson" aircraft carrier has deployed with F-35C fighter jets and CMV-22 "Osprey" carrier-based transport aircraft.
Now patrolling the Pacific Ocean are U.S. aircraft carriers, including not only the "Carl Vinson," but also the "Abraham Lincoln" (USS Abraham Lincoln) aircraft carrier, which set sail from the United States on January 3rd.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the US Navy currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region also includes the USS Ronald Reagan, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Shamplain Lake" missile cruiser and the "Stockdale" missile destroyer, among others.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are gathering around China.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) US three aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. January 17, 2022, US Navy carrier-borne transport aircraft CMV-22B flight route.
(Weibo @South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a report by the US Cable News Network (CNN) on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada," carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the U.S. Naval Base in Guam last Saturday (January 15th).
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. Analysts say this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the India-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a U.S. ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam. In recent years, China has built a large number of military facilities in the South China Sea islands.
The picture shows China's Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio-class nuclear submarine "USS Nevada" to Guam has strengthened cooperation between the United States and its regional allies, demonstrating the U.S.'s capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are commonly known as "Boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 "Thundering Submarines" in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly confidential.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes the "Thundering Submarine" the "most important survival weapon in the nuclear triad," which also includes land-based missile silos in the United States and bombers such as the B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking with friends about the recent 26% drop in Meta's stock, a market value evaporation of 251 billion US dollars, Zuckerberg responded, "facing unprecedented competition." What is the reason?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with its main revenue coming from advertisements. Nowadays, profitable advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising alliance", with many apps connecting to Meta's advertisements, and monetizing through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is very user-friendly, and it clearly prompts users whether to allow the App to access their information. The normal reaction of most people is definitely not to allow it.
If Google takes another stab, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly contributed by Chinese companies doing overseas business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its Hong Kong office, and there are several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand into overseas markets, and Meta is an indispensable advertising channel. Most of the money spent goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made quite a bit of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
Domestic agencies are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta's performance in the Greater China region is also quite good.
Recently, I haven't specifically looked into it, but it definitely won't be better than before.
Chinese companies' phase of spending large amounts of money overseas has already passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not going smoothly.
Facebook is getting older and older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in income, but the lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets not only focus on income, but more importantly, they look at future expectations.
It is quite clear that Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the "metaverse."
The metaverse is indeed one of the directions for the future, but the implementation cycle of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story may not be enough to support Meta's market value in the next two or three years.
So the next two years should be a relatively difficult time for Meta.
Don't be fooled by Facebook's current prosperity, with annual revenues of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars. In fact, Facebook now has a strong sense of crisis. Compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms, it doesn't have a good, secure moat for protection.
Although his several social media apps have relatively high daily active users and are mainstream social media apps, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., facing the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook does not have much confidence, and the subversion can happen in the blink of an eye.
Creating a metaverse, an unattainable concept, has no hope of success in a short period of time, which is why Facebook is very dangerous. This is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the company's name and constantly seeks new tracks. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and is a dead end. The above are some of my thoughts for reference.

During this joint exercise, the Chinese and Vietnamese armies focused on the important topic of humanitarian medical rescue, closely following the mission of medical treatment and saving the wounded. They completed joint medical command, joint on-site rescue, and mass casualty management according to actual combat standards, effectively improving the medical support capabilities of both armies.

The results of the exercise demonstrated the professional capabilities of the two countries' military medical forces in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
The head of the Chinese guidance and coordination group and deputy director of the Health Bureau of the Logistics Support Department of the Central Military Commission, Chen Chunming, said that this exercise is another pioneering and innovative practice based on the successful joint medical consultation event held in 2018, and has very important milestone significance.
