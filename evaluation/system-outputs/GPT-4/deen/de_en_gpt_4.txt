The item cost under 20 Euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
I fundamentally also believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it does older siblings good to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Just take a quick look, give a little help, bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are included.
As long as they can still be enough of a child themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 occupies themselves for a short time and it's OK for them, then that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether that is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany them for hours while they fall asleep.
From a purely legal standpoint, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that's where the statement from the psychologist comes from.
For if something were to actually happen, such as a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether that's a risk you want to take is, of course, up to your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, I just can't remember the title at all, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and entering the enclosure of his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a female commissioner who, after a brief investigation, ends up with his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.

In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.

Facing this fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with a fire.
This is roughly the plot, I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone is familiar with this plot or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I need to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 y., splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outer side) along the entire length.
Have tried to pull him out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No chance anymore.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining the digital decoder and sound module on a single circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 gauge tracks.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker including a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with a suitable digital control center.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, CV values can be read on the main track with suitable control centers.
For central units that can only program CVs from 1-255, auxiliary registers exist.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.

Due to Omicron: Johnson wants to accelerate booster vaccination
Ever-increasing Omicron cases worry politics and science in the United Kingdom.
By New Year's, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the Corona booster vaccinations than previously aimed for, in view of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen.
So far, the target date has been the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
We are facing an emergency due to the Omicron variant, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Get your booster now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omicron cases were registered in the United Kingdom, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation to a conversation came by email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter," but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him/her and depending on where he/she has a cultural background from, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and just don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them leave.
Only the one thing I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had a non-apparent defect at the time of sale.
How can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working for about.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 though.
However, there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and invoice me for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write here somewhat in detail about domestic violence.
I just have to write something off my chest.
I (21) frequently come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims do not accept help or think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.

But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It never gets easier though.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How good is the series based on "League of Legends"?
Much fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced second season?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Again, nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick, looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
The situation did not calm down after the game - but rather increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was even more disappointing than the bare result was the manner of the performance.
Representatively, a statistic should be mentioned that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had practiced."
Namely, to move the ball.
A completely different reaction came from his counterpart Sebastian Gleim: "A great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best playmaker I have ever coached," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points, after they had already been behind 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for brooding.
Already on Wednesday (7 pm), the Giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already contacted a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have obtained legal advice again and have therefore contacted you again.
We originally contacted you half a year ago.
Always dressed to the nines: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been rescheduled to May 2022 - "on official order" to contain the Corona virus.
Other planned appearances during the Advent season will also have to be canceled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
Starting in January, the artists want to make up for their dates that were already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has enjoyed singing a lot since his teenage years.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is indispensable in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance?
It should be complemented with existing furniture and thus we could check beforehand whether the colors match.
It still doesn't work, I can only see the cover page but not flip through.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with the assurance that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations is, by the way, the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party wants to appoint an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
If the situation does not ease, however, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent control until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax nevertheless, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and after a few days I realized that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I will redeem it independently with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?

This is an absolute outrage
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept across the USA.
Alone in Kentucky, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night leading into Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and possibly claimed up to a hundred fatalities.
The storms leave behind a swath of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
The governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado had raced through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that display case #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or has it been completely removed from the range?
Is there the possibility to order this display case in another country?
by when will you get in touch?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, the one that is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form or submitted a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or is being processed, as I have not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He switched to a company he had badmouthed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see and drink tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself to his old position and looked for something else.
You may do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, whatever.
He didn't really like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I create a screenshot.

Assistance with first own campaign
Greetings from Boron!
I am currently running the adventure Over the Griffon Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play TDE 5.
The big arc is created, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts thought out, and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There, the further action is supposed to develop.
A few miles away from the village, a group of goblins is said to be lying in wait for the heroes and luring them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: Persuade, Trade, Threaten, recognize the danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a hollow path and flank the wagon with three on each side armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two approaches to a solution.
1. The heroes all become unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-elf, along with two of his servants, intervenes and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you consider Deus ex Machina for Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now have more confidence in my narrative again.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would still like to send them back.
Can you then send the return labels, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so with this post I want to let off some steam.
First of all, today the broadcast was interrupted right in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and the starting accident had put the schedule far behind the planning, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it seems that for legal reasons F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes handled the difficult situation around the severe accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge about the rules in F1 among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that this option was available for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first guessing game about what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules; both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like the contrived comment style of Roos, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But seriously, I even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them appear simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest to the comment, as he apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply gets out of hand on Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV since only the German audio track has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also show less advertising during the training sessions than Sky, and that as free-to-air channels.
Indeed, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials.
At least that's how the magnificent F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For this one here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant light, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12/12/19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifts.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect several diffusers.
The MK series has one, two, or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but is also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here, a treasure chest, shell, or something similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to a diffuser or similar using an air hose 4/6 mm...and it can start right away.
The fan pump should be level with, or higher than the water level and be mounted externally.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be inserted in between.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to flow backwards once, that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture.
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, packages are packed daily and are also picked up daily from here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to take some precautions so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer once.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course, Corona doesn't stop here either.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment,... they have a damn hard time
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and host into space
The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a brilliantly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Amid the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they each paid for their ticket was not disclosed by Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his assignments and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Even Michael Strahan expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space immediately, said the presenter.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, detached from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, temporarily experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object slowed down and landed again with the help of large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned space excursion by Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second one in October, 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently shine in one color or cycle through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the luminous stone retains a light color for about one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light proves itself year-round outdoors.
In snowy surroundings, their light looks particularly good - only a shorter duration of illumination can be expected when the days get shorter.
In winter, please just make sure that no snow impairs the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMH battery in the common Mignon ("AA") format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can obtain a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the usage time of your decorative light even further.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite exciting in itself, and I also don't mind working in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely want to study up to the doctorate level.
Currently, however, I have doubts, especially the job prospects are weighing heavily on me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), you always hear about great job opportunities and the profession being in high demand, on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
So I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and considering possibly dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to write them down as well :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
That's why only now a post about it.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that it's also available before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week, a long 4-day weekend was coming up.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loads of emails that absolutely had to go out before Ascension Day, order here order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that must not be allowed?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also quite annoyed.
What is the point of this self-flagellation over holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we're not allowed to properly enjoy them?!
The stress, mind you, did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent like that.
My question is simply this: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Protestant way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she doesn't have any gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing is, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you can simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the party by baking cookies and doing crafts with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to finally get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping can be attributed exclusively to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no additional vitamin supplement should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Still not working, unfortunately
DDR handicraft model old building E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway enthusiast ME issue 11/1968, used with play traces and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been restored to working condition.
The German Reichsbahn Society commissioned AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a travel speed of 45 km/h on this route.
A top speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive, AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, and Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves afterwards on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as reparations goods.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn repair shop in Dessau, the refurbishment worthiness of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare part donors.
In the process, the more numerous E 04, E 44, and E 94 were initially given priority for construction.
Only when it became apparent with the E 94 that the number of refurbishments could not be increased any further, the E 95 came into focus for refurbishment.
[4]Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway depot.
They arrived at the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were mainly used in a separate circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig, and Erfurt.
Problematic with increasing age was the complicated control system in the locomotives.
Thus, it often happened that switches would stick during switching operations.
Then the assistant, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to release the contactors with a hammer and wooden wedge while the train was in motion.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to month-long failures of the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available by the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operations was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could do without old locomotives and most of the minority classes, so the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to staff electric locomotives with only one person, which would have caused a problem in train operations due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were decommissioned in mid-1969, the last to follow was the E 95 01, which retired from service on October 5, 1970.
The intended new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at the main station in Halle.
It took some time before the responsible parties at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle exhibition in RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive is looked after as a museum exhibit.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint job, during which the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in service until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching secondary lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical rework on the locomotive necessary in own work, dusty, with play traces, basement smell !!!, very rare handcrafted model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may show labels and storage marks.
Yes, it's the F-parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is supported by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot assemble the bed.
The center beam is supported by two feet, which are unfortunately produced with defects.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I will get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent off?
no, no flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
With me, they are not flat
Could I have this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect deliberate arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck have taken over the further investigations.
But that arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To debunk fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously commented publicly on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin announced.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false information that I supposedly was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, Şahin continued to write.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts; sometimes it is better to share personal experiences for this reason.
On the internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself also clarified.
"Currently, I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire at transformer station: Tens of thousands of people without power
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to manage without electricity for about 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The utility company Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the extensive disruption could finally be completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and female helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The utility company thanked the affected individuals for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will take a few more days, as the Westnetz technicians were initially only able to put some lines back into operation on a provisional basis, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Power flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at around 7:15 pm has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work is necessary.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm onwards.
Since 11:15 pm, even those last affected by the outage have had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in operation.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday afternoon after setting up emergency power supplies for important buildings.
"It is important now that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhood and report to the local fire department buildings if help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical devices or relied on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy that from you and pay in Euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the subframe on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
we have received 155cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot slide them together and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a response
yes that is really easier!
Then let's do it this way!
send me the return label by email?
the repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that
Nordic Combined: Combined athlete Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to admit defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started on the cross-country track with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redid it and are using version 4.5...
it could be that they have already heard of problems more often
Bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message appears, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between as well!
To ensure an even and clean application of paint, you should clean the components with some soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model with a new color for the first time, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Slight overlap of the color layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid quickly swiping back and forth with the brush.
As a result, surfaces appear unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might otherwise show through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are applied at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks may occur if they mix with regular colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them.
True-to-original appearance is achieved by the models through decals or transfer pictures.
From national insignia on airplanes to ship names and decorative trim on car models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easily accessible.
An airplane cockpit can be more easily covered with decals before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools like scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are time, patience, and a steady hand when applying adhesive.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them for yourself.
Decals are also called water slide images because you moisten their backside briefly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the dampness.
Then you slide the image just a small distance from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper sideways.
Attention: Always check first if the image is positioned correctly before you completely slide it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle, or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look at something else, I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and search for the spot up to where I have read.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you once before.
Will I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place
ok anyway thank you very much!
then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Will I get that back without any problems?
Fertility treatment for private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to settling the bill with the private health insurance, they suddenly refuse.
One after the other:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were in no way limited (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed through the private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet settle these with the private health insurance.
We applied again for the cost coverage from the private health insurance and were granted another 3 attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically billing the most expensive ones with the private health insurance), we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and received the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)?
Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the commitments that with a birth, the further attempts are forfeited?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help already!
Can you please send me the three versions by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
Alright.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If you add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you have obviously lost good customers.
You are welcome to forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was initiated, and now you're telling me that I have to send the item back first.
I can't help it if the dresser arrives completely disturbed at my place
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It clearly states that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and be able to make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools available for purchase, but unfortunately, we cannot find them at your place.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What exactly constitutes a low-budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
Am a very good customer of yours, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much
Kind regards
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at high cost for the EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs, however, are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Protestant News Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, stated the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus doesn't quite give in, but the EU feels like the winner - will probably continue for a while longer.
The treatment of people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, judged Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively turn against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development simultaneously weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state decides to do its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy is being made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Repeated attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested during the night on Sunday and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated medically by a military doctor.
In total, the border patrol registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard-hitting measures and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly funnel thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I will speak with the bank and get back to you again
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fan Day
The Europa-Park, namesake for the Europa-Park Stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white that day through the jerseys.
Little Fox, Ed Euromouse, and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day at Europa-Park, it once again became clear how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?
Stages in the career of the new world champion Verstappen
Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new Formula 1 world champion.
Max Verstappen has done it.
The Dutchman clinches his first World Championship title in his seventh year in Formula 1 with Red Bull.
His path to the summit of the royal class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen loses the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him angrily at a gas station on the return journey.
His mother Sophie Kumpen picks up the teenager in the car following behind.
2014, England: The Red Bull junior team gets promising talent in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old thus follows in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
At that time, he initially continues in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: Verstappen starts at the age of 17 years and 166 days as the youngest pilot in history in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he has to park his Toro Rosso in Melbourne prematurely.
2015, Malaysia: At the time, Toro Rosso driver Verstappen was also the youngest racer at 17 years and 180 days to score points in Formula 1.
Verstappen finishes in seventh place at the Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang.
2016, Spain: In his first race for Red Bull, Verstappen wins immediately.
At 18 years and 228 days, he sensationally becomes the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his pole premiere in Budapest - he is not the youngest.
At 21 years old, he leaves Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
Verstappen celebrates his first World Championship title at the age of 24 at the Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi - with an overtaking maneuver against Hamilton in the final lap. dpa
Back then, I already had a huge problem with them when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# dresser.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also served as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast, and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for the return of an item yesterday, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my inquiry has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your stupid chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not everyone from our household.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to be brought to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Kind regards

Sorry but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
That's like when someone from the AfD says they have nothing against foreigners.
Your i admit both will not.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just completely leave it.
Yes wow, then you are as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set everything in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spouting nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass virtually distortion-free and without color errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifying glasses are labeled with magnification specifications.
These specifications apply only to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, please observe the notes in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses - light reflections occur.
With an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When observing the optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instruction manual (available in German and English).

Fir tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced quite a few curious situations during the sale of fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even driven home without his partner because the two could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for this purpose.
In doing so, the 56-year-old has already experienced quite a few curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas season a bit funny, he says.
And what about the voucher??
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their name for this reason.
In English, an equivalent might be something like the "twister," which doesn't sound nearly as delicious.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble setting up a stable Wifi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, apart from a few failures, received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590, and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, at the other DLAN module, which emits the Wifi, the full 500 no longer arrive, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less arrives (i.e., using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the internet being slower on the first floor with the new fiber optic connection than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was indeed slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely laborious to lay LAN cables in the house now.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here specifically.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased to receive a response.
When it's time to switch the checking account
Who would have thought that there would be peace with the current accounts for now is mistaken.
While many banks have used the fall to have their past fee increases confirmed by their customers using all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to decrease.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just halved the tax-free allowance and even quartered it for the overnight deposit.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already previously lowered the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, popular among cost-conscious customers, has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Even Sparda-Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still an ongoing legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now there is already discussion in the banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the higher instances also declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally inadmissible and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life resembles a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For her, who caused a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, Aniston admits, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: just ONE SINGLE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of female and male fans nevertheless fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe, because she simply has bad luck with happiness - and is still searching for great love.
And has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the barrier, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport premier class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in the Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich achieves 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The goal of the bobsleigh pilot is to reach the record of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories.
"I've calculated it, I would have to achieve nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he fended off the attack from Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, moving from rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he achieved a larger lead of 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he prevailed over the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden native Johannes Lochner, who competes for Stuttgart, finished in fifth place this time after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women's event, Laura Nolte secured her third seasonal victory in the two-woman bobsleigh on her home track.
After finishing only fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory on Sunday with pusher Deborah Levi in the German triple success.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She achieved not only her Olympic qualification but also her first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he had expired, which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently discounted :)
Why will the shipping only start on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field with the message appear.
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we would still like the shelf module, just a new undamaged one
And do not cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear amazing girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write down and maybe some others feel the same way...
I am 24, have cPTSD, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is bandaged due to burn).
He is also catching a cold and we currently see each other less (1-2x a week), which is very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month right now.
Now we also have housework coming our way, which we will naturally divide among ourselves.
But cooking myself is currently a lot of work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently quite well managed, I am halfway decently treated and getting by.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues, right?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental reference points, because otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't manage it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I cannot put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has partly to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would surely find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening in any case, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately it is a completely different color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark.
With the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed back in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
For me, that was always somewhat strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I somehow always believed.
What is your opinion on that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum and so on.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What then leads one to want to teach religion if one does not believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
Hope the question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well too.
That's already very long, then I would refrain from it
Is good, thank you.
I expect a response promptly, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it more closely anyway, there is a young woman in the real world.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and a plot unfolds.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live himself, I think.
The transition is, I believe, also the burial site of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight against each other, I believe.
If that means anything to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has slept on their stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child can endure much more than one might think.
Make sure everything around is right, no stuffed animals, go in and check more often, but no minute surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when they sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it raise itself up a bit from its stomach?
Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
From this, you can deduce whether everything is in order.
We all grew up too, and when my husband was born, for example, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought many items.
But why are you offering me only 20 EUR then?
Hello, I already wrote to one of your colleagues yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not usable.
To put it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station have become absolutely terrible by now.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also going on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a walking advertising column".
What is one now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising channel trying to sell its cheap merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The rules naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they are allowed to continue insulting people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to cash in at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can one find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I request a callback, as my delivered wooden table was delivered damaged.
Corpus fracture due to damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling – My little Warm Friend is versatile in its use.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is exclusively suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odors, mold or scorch marks and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
In the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes heat (observe the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Afterwards, place the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the initial heating, slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Strictly follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can cause damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that the manufacturer's instructions allow for the heating of grain products.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in cases of acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises, and open wounds, as well as in individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and out of reach for children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be regularly monitored during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first half of the season - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well under the third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought, power supply alone is also sufficient for operation.
No luck, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start anymore despite the plugged-in power adapter.
As a result, I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on mains power?
Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
Don't know, though, how high the seat surface is.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
20 liters of capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in everyday items, thanks to practical access points, remains well organized and separable from the camera equipment in the individually configurable interior space.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the messenger bags.
Inside the closure flap, there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, sturdily riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, take a lower one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you not only take your camera equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more on that below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side to the front of your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday as confirmation for the commissioning of the
Contact initiated by the forwarding company to pick up the incorrectly delivered table announced.
So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, with none of them did I get further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
Is it then foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Many many thanks for the help
Wishing you a pleasant evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than the one I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, I will place a larger order immediately, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have foreseen and therefore could not redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But I, as a customer, have suffered the damage and I do not accept it like this.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers apparently have the same idea!
You must surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly works for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style through fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The promoter turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the promoter has moved five times, thus covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunslingers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I accept the shipping method, merchandise shipment (games wrapped in foil), up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, usually DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games wrapped in foil, surrounded by fleece and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can also ship cardboard in cardboard for an additional charge of 2 Euros, so that there will be 100% no pressure marks.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians now raise serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people nowadays think and act differently.
To us parents and other responsible persons, it must never, never, never! be about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States discuss dropping testing requirement for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We states need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the testing requirement can be waived for those vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on this matter as early as next Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however, I cannot see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer process a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer works.
I have updated the account information.
What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most frequently, this involves hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images, and very rarely perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are surgeries that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine does indeed describe awareness correctly, however, by definition, u/Nitemarex had none.
Misread your comment.
The chair is, however, defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is, in addition to the legal obligation, also standard in the eCommerce sector.
Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
There we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarding agent is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
am I not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies aged 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man gets older".
The shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby already express my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
In 2020, according to data from Statistik Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not recorded
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in regular playtime against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the penalty shootout with 4:2.
In the Eastern Conference final, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
There was this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery tender!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've acquired a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef stock for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
What happens now?
What is with the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I can manage that
It is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 01/18 by email that the refund was made.
But until today the money has not arrived for me.
Would you please check there.
Where you can still get Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of the Christmas holidays as the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amp contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion.
Further up it was already hinted that with the POWER LEVEL control, you can even mobilize a power reserve when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, allowing you to jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
Those who treat themselves to an additional VFS5 footswitch can also conveniently call up the sounds with their foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
Had seen that with others though.
Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me with this?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher as well.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 Euros for goods I don't need is a bit too much after all.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended to be part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement
During the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress is emerging according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had resumed after a break of almost one week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a corona incidence above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care units in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, that's it, right?
here I don't have to click/indicate/fill in anything else?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return shipment at my own expense, please.
8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, an outrage.
It is time for changes
MBundestag greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the point of the post here?
When looking at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one thing can be determined: It is non-existent.
We have entered a winter hibernation and have extended the summer slump for several months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the cause?
For the most part, this is probably simply due to dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we generally appear.
In recent days, it has increasingly become apparent that many people here are genuinely still interested in the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community surrounding the MBundestag is asked, who wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in recent days and found, simply put, a shambles.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing arrangements need to be changed / adjusted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not bad, that's what we have the Discord for in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for that and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversized, like in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for the pickup - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have to get these or decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself once lived vegetarian for a while, currently also very rarely eats meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years before.
In response to the question of whether I always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And indeed, I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that ultimately I also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that discontent arose on her part, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one reduces animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, you quickly get put into a corner and conflicts arise without intending to provoke them.
A harmony-loving vegan greets you (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be on site on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either.
Can an alternative pick-up date please be assigned to me.
From the 01.02.#NUMBER#, I can be found continuously again.
Lahnsteiner Weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz presented a grant notification of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Brigade to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving squad, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they permanently expect increasing deployments: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
Followed their recommendations, but synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Okay, it is like that.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for facing this whole issue here, I also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, meaning we were also weapon carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into more detail about that!
I always find the question of right and left to be very oversimplified.
Basically, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
It should be clear to everyone that, of course, uniforms and weapons carriers in particular magically attract people to the right of conservative, and it should also be clear that these people then naturally have difficulty dealing with the lived reality, because, of course, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggeratedly feminine stereotype gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive, but rather completely normal men and women who you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and I can and must rely on these people as well, because in doubt they will save your life or risk theirs for you.
But even these fringe groups, as strange as it may sound at first, represent a conservative attitude in my experience, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less addressed by exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly advocates for them or thinks it has to please them, when in fact they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-endangering plans is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that especially police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, start to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that like-minded people with right-wing views meet and engage in lively exchanges of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well combated and counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply entangled internationally, and in my opinion, that's a good thing, that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation
It is still about my order, which is no longer available for delivery.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, one could also deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black to Germany, or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep notches, which have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Tidier through child?
Hello, something has been bothering me (f32) for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have managed to keep my household clean and tidy more poorly than properly.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's actually never the case that "someone could spontaneously come for a visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly household simply loses against work and unwillingness.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet but are working on it and this question has been bothering me for quite some time.
For me, there is no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give you more motivation or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and thus allows for almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Preforming with a special, further embossing at the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled in order to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends)

Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and putting on equipment at the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and on the back, guarantees increased flexibility for arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head hood)
Soft, collar-located zone improves sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro fastener, which does not stick to the lamination or the seams.
Double cuffs with zipper on wrist and ankle joints connect a foldable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff.
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when putting on.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the wetsuit without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (jumpsuit without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush glued with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs hemmed for greater load capacity
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristband computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure self-personality disorder?
I completed a training in the field of software development and have now been fully qualified for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering for some time to start over and study social work.
The problem: I have a self-uncertain (or anxious-avoidant) personality disorder (AAPD).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I have been told several times that I seem unapproachable (although I believe that has already improved).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
I don't know, however, if the actual workday is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.

I will probably have these problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But you have already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by giving back please!
When I have downloaded a book onto the #PRS_ORG#, the message appears: Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book.
are there any problems there?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, they asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) ingested with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein components (amino acids) and, in turn, builds up its own body proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
Feather formation in the nestling and feather regeneration in the molting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this can lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this course-like administration of NEKTON-Bio, one should switch back to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given initially until the onset of new feather growth is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a municipal employee in contradiction to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So application for a permit submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I believe that, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
As the police press alert currently reports (2:03 pm), a car has entered oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you all!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good, because my dear head is currently overthinking everything that can be overthought.
Before I go into detail here .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the refresher course as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something different and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was it - even though the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now reached the third "I google other job postings."
And only half a year has passed.
In the times before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can still switch.
But right now I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely drained.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but back then my weekend was also my weekend and my after-work time was my after-work time.
I had the day off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well, as far as feedback and such is concerned.
But I am completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already doing that.
I wonder if I want to have it like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was appreciated, could take time off when I needed it, and found the work somehow boring, but was paid adequately for it and worked together in a team instead of being a lone fighter as is the case most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't end up in the same place in a year as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You notice, everything is somehow confused, but maybe you as outsiders have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, that I am completely done and practically start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions emotionally right now, as it probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and excuse the whiny undertone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which, among other things, has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they achieve the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier simply better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances simply bubble out.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 led to another performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the power amp stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier, and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and tonal character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough for a victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your camera equipment and is suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, lasting 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 soccer fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new land spits with a total size of about 50 hectares were formed by cooled lava.
The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit and was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and additional areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
All the more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas holidays with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the window of three women in one night to save them from a further life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular custom in Germany emerged to fill the boots, especially those of children, with gifts.
Protestants took offense at this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and people as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons, they object to the institution.
Martin Luther turned Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer take such detailed questions so seriously, it only annoys a few that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's tradition with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, you can find everything your heart desires, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources document a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a cheerful confusion about the question of who actually brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been attributed over time.
This includes, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at the Christmas celebration.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost achieved some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was said to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a weapon.
The man fled in a vehicle, according to authorities, which was stopped by officers shortly thereafter.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
In the area around Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
which ones?

The decorative light blends harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminous duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
Completely harmless, on the other hand, is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows how to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparation work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither cables nor batteries.
Place the "luminous stone" in any location that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two included ground spikes ensure a firm hold when needed.
The matte white plastic casing itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
Its solar module is discreetly hidden inside "Smart Stone", along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At the onset of twilight, "Smart Stone" automatically starts to glow; you decide the color: In addition to daylight white, you have a choice of six attractive light colors.
The shutdown also ultimately occurs automatically as soon as the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day.
I have already done this several times and it does not work.

Pill Problem
Hello dear womenfolk,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
Regarding my problem: About five years ago, I reluctantly started taking the pill again, mainly because I had such incredibly severe pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stop doing that again, because due to chronic illnesses I already have to take enough medications that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had suddenly gotten pimples from 0 to 100 during my last approximately two-year break and had them everywhere.
As far as that goes, it's superficial, but it really weighed on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two years break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again.
Fragrance-free and without fuss, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Gynecologist unfortunately didn't take me very seriously and dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis prepubertally, then a period of calm, then widespread nodular prurigo and the acne issue.
I have also tried all sorts of diets in the course of chronic illness and ended up sticking to a low-sugar, low-milk, and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else really worked well.
It could also be that there is simply a hormonal issue, but if you have problems everywhere like me, you don't really want to go looking for what else might be going wrong.
I had already told everything to her colleague semina or similar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work in between and answer the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally available in large
since it is available in large black

In the name of the people: Laypeople make judgments with
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.

110-kV underground cable will be newly constructed in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk announced this now.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue order number:#PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass dresser and the entire sides have burst open, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it is with all books, that's why the inquiry at #PRS_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I am currently still having major problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped technically, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors and for me, each lesson actually stands on its own.
In principle, the methods also always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (I also need that time for lesson observations, etc.).
I always start with the learning objective when planning (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore, the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible first.
The trade fears for the Christmas business due to the 2G regulation.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments declines in sales.
He also has a possible solution at hand.
The 2G regulations, from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
In business with non-daily necessities, there are drops in sales to complain about, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies have a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in the food retail sector and in the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G while shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deter customers and require a high level of personnel deployment.
The ribbon control must be allowed nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only needs to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores on that day with the received wristband.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
Even the shopping center-focused real estate company Deutsche Euroshop spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, and revenues were at about 90 percent.
These numbers will certainly drop now, right in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche."
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof at a central point in the center and afterwards - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
What do I need to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery)
User memory The memory can store up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and done.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is restored when switching on again - Very practical for studio work, for example when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display indicators (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the spotlight using the supplied power adapter.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
For mounting, you have a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locking devices on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can easily and safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Too bad, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the recently twice consecutively winless Hesse team seemingly found themselves on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then SGE turned up the heat, scoring within a good hour to vent their frustration over a mixed season start and winning furiously with a 5:2 score. "It's incredible what the boys have achieved today," cheered coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN and expressed a "general praise, to each individual who was involved."
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead with 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result as well.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with particular joy for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to "proceed step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next up, as part of the English week, there is an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 pm, Sky) on the schedule for Wednesday.
Just received an email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, this would mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for handball women before quarterfinal against Spain

At the end of the World Championship main round, the DHB team suffered a bitter defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to approach differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a pity that we couldn't maintain the flow.
That was a bad game from everyone, which we have to delete," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not up to par
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par from the kickoff.
Missed throws and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women could hardly make a scene - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in goal for the Scandinavians.
Thus, the game was already decided at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke was also shown a red card shortly afterwards due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team get somewhat better into the game and at least closed the gap to five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team could not muster any more improvement in performance and left the court as clear losers.

does that work for you?
The title suggests it, I work as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely completed, I will then partly continue to vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility, the education about vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and there are no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (has never happened to me) are included.
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who are not able to perform vaccinations (are not allowed?), so I also perform most of the vaccinations myself there.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What please is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, the BR television show "We in Bayern" has caused quite a bit of pondering.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous."
And also no one, "who needs everything to happen quickly."
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
Upon which the man from Amberg shared the solution, and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate residents.
"The Huidlerer," the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which an educational gap was closed - probably also for some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
It always shows the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have reset the #PRS_ORG#, restarted it, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said and done, and I took off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire absolutely didn't want to participate for the rest of the route.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a somewhat bad mood and take the first available train home.
It wasn't quite as bad mood-wise, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tire again before the bike tour.
Now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me over several days, I would be extremely reluctant to encounter this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't bad, as even the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who rode 120km until 2 pm on the day I came to pick up the bike!) were also described as suboptimal, because he had been riding them on rollers for several years.
But when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90kms of driving, I believe I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't really feel like spending 40€/tire right now, just to end up being disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have, I believe, 25x622 on my racing bike.
There are those too (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend other tires for a racing bike?
The swallow page seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute layman's knowledge?
Thank you in advance for the help and best regards!
Car skids into tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten when his car collided with a central island for an unexplained reason and then ended up on the opposite lane, as the police reported.
There, it came to a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was trapped inside the vehicle.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end wideband speaker B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would expand again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually resembles the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to its principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound quality is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not capable of generating such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and, for her size, extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight increase in treble.
This is common practice for broadband systems to optimize the strong increase in bundling at excessively high frequencies.
Precisely aligned to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outward, the treble range can be reduced, making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the localization of individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that is unparalleled.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended to think about the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, in order to incorporate appropriate changes during construction.
If one wants to veneer the housing, for example, the recess of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer adds more material.
After all the panels have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate location to be able to easily route the cable through it later.
Using a router, the speaker opening is now made in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be flush-mounted later.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
Onto this, the back wall, the lid, the front, and the bottom are now glued.
In the process, the three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if required, for example, if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next work step, the second page will be attached.
After that, all plates of the foot follow, i.e. both sides, as well as the front.
By using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill bit, the installation of the openings for the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Subsequently, a round cutter is used to round off all edges of the actual box.
The top side of the base plate can also be rounded off with this.
Afterwards, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
Next is the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), the cable laying process begins.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
In doing so, push the entire and uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base up to the terminal opening and let it protrude about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the housing, guide the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang loosely there as well.
The following prepares and implements the crossover.
The circuit diagram of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram, can be found in the following document: Assembly Instructions Crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box follows, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass reflex opening and with a little skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and seal it this way.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the sealing can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
In the end, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex port should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered only at the beginning of June?
Hello to everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Due to well-known reasons, unfortunately, we are unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the call, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold already, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
