From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzac-age ladies based on their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belles-lettres from the perspective of those very Balzacian ladies.
But the psychology and sufferings of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are generally rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.
It is possible that the roses were plush to depict a certain sort of them?
There are roses of such a color and with such a leaf structure resembling velvet, usually dark red or burgundy tones.
And the light roses look different, the petals have just the right satin or silky shine.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
The "Micro-package Prestige" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different firmness on the sides: the medium-firm surface is made of latex-coated coconut fiber and natural latex, the moderately soft side is made of a natural latex plate.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeping person, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight the breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for air permeability, is well ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping area is preserved.
The extended warranty period also applies to the mattress.
The official manufacturer's warranty period is 5 years, in practice the mattress service life is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a removable jacquard cover included in the set.
Buy an orthopedic pillow to go with your mattress - it is recommended for maintaining optimal spinal alignment during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the spine, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrey, it has been clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher won't be able to help either, he wasn't taught that, the schoolchildren play games in Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember these feasts and guests in my parents' house with horror.
Guests are at the door, and the cutlets are still frying on the stove, the mother is rushing to mop the floor.
Lord, he sat down at the table already without strength.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag the products, two days of cooking, cleaning up the day after.
And what about the guests?
They are good, and they also have to bring a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table with the minimum.
And I cook them delicious treats, bake very often just like that.
Germany: The fourth vaccination against the coronavirus is inevitable.
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practice Doctors, Ulrich Weigel, is convinced of this.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall," says the expert.
In addition, Wiegel hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with vaccination against the flu".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, intensified vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new coronavirus strain "Omikron".
Moreover, the new variant is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with "Omikron" is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Zalzberger, advocates for reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Furthermore, according to Zalzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is very convincing in this regard," the expert emphasized.
Pontoon21 Bet-A Vib 54 Silent 54 mm 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
She (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the use of sub-ice fishing in mind, not just for casting.
These lures have a higher specific weight than their close-sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper soft plastic from strong and elastic plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vib" when fishing with Bet-A-Vib, it shows quite aggressive game.
Often the most sensitive is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the rod up and down almost without pause.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles, for which a snag is possible.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when catching pike and large perch in winter, especially in the middle of winter, when a pinpoint and aggressive bait presentation is required.
Reaching the end point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise-canceling capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent). ---
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is capable of annoying a passive pike, which does not even react to live bait.
When fishing with Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates range and accuracy.
This lure is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with the line and braided ropes even of large diameters.
For catching pike, pike perch, burbot or perch, in addition to uniform and current, "step" is sometimes useful, with "chirping" on the bottom.
If you are fishing in tangled places, you can change the front treble to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is one of the most durable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catching.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively small and quite deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, it was reported that there are 7,000 Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner".
The Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri announced this on Sunday, December 12.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group in Libya.
They have airplanes too.
They also dig trenches in Sirt and Kufra.
They have 30 reactive aircraft on the Gardabia air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirt) - Anadolu agency reports.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are trying to "seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Preserve the presence.
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirt, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency notes.
Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group enjoys Kremlin support.
Where else can mercenaries be?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is reportedly operating in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as supplies of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, the article says.
According to the media, the "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the CAR.
This group is not registered with any government agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not on the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under sanctions from the United States.
We remind you that earlier the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved the restrictions against "Wagner".
It is expected that the European Union Council will approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya.
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions dominated by Islamists, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for parliamentary and state head elections from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the material notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, according to Sky News Arabia.
External policy through the eyes of Russians.
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
Examples of successes - "in Syria we protected and restored peace there", "the decision on "North Stream-2"", "we scared the whole world with our cool weapons", "we took Crimea back".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - says the study of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper-based administration - all government services have also become digital only.
The Dubai government announced its complete rejection of paper-based administration and transition to digital technologies.
All state services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the UAE information agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new stage of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said the Emirati crown prince, chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on Saturday.
Now the internal and external document flow in all Dubai government institutions will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and utilities, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities calculated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Given, well, about birth dates and how old the child is, this is already a farce, about the class and group in the kindergarten too.
I can't believe that such scammers exist.
And if they do exist, they clearly don't care about anything, including their family.

These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
The production and export of cars in Turkey have fallen below the level of 2020.
The production and export of cars in Turkey sharply declined in November due to the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance for the first 11 months was worse than last year's results, according to Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November in Turkey 115 thousand cars were produced, which is 20% less than the previous year.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
If the automotive sector in Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than the previous year's figure in the 11 months of 2021.
The cause of this decline was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
Over 500 subjects of the SME received a deferment on credit payments in 2021.
The first deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with providing benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of Kazinform.
According to the information of the Republic of Kazakhstan Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, in the current year, in accordance with the instructions of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the Chairman of the Agency issued Order No. 127 "On Approval of the Procedure for Providing Deferral of Payments on Loans to Small and Medium-Sized Businesses" on April 9, 2021 - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the order of providing payment deferral on loans provided for the provision of payment deferral by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SME subjects, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the discretion of the MSB subject.
In the borrower's statement, another payment deferral period could be indicated.
During the deferment period, the borrower's claim and lawsuit work, notice of the need to repay overdue debt, and the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments were suspended, the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, 603 borrowers-subjects of SME applied for a payment deferral to second-level banks, of which 553 SME subjects received a deferral of 9.7 billion tenge.
"In the MFO, applications for a deferral were submitted by 131 subjects of SME, of which a deferral was granted to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puriasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily carry the "okmiron" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to carry it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puriasev explained why the "okmiron" coronavirus strain may be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the virus's emergence.
Scientists believe that "okimon" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
That is, upon mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the lack of response from the immune system, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are more of these spike proteins, thorns, maybe, than usual, their antibodies were not reduced during mutations - comments pulmonologist Sergei Puriassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to carry "okmirone" easier than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the organism to something, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the organism can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections when 30-year-olds die and 60-year-olds just sneeze it off.
The immune response was crazy in the young man, he was completely inadequate: where he could only threaten with his finger, he beats like a cannon at sparrows, - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, symptoms can often only be suppressed - all hope is on the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may start getting vaccinated by the end of the year.
The virologist and head of the genomics engineering laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
The number of contacts is maximum for teenagers who go to school.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as the children of kindergartens, said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering at MIPT.
Huge thanks to the author for this article.
I refreshed my memories with pleasure...

In the distant seventies-eighties, no dance floor was without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they organized dances to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of covid.
The authors of the study studied the fat tissue remaining from bariatric operations and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can be infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in fat tissue, macrophages, also became infected, showing a strong inflammatory response in the process.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid the response of the immune system.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of this.
The biologist explained the reasons for the emergence of dementia.
The candidate of biological sciences, Semen Golosheikin, named the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about ways of its prevention in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting themselves even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that most often, demencia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins. ---
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
"At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," added the biologist.
To prevent the occurrence of WHO diseases, it is recommended to maintain the necessary level of physical activity, train cognitive skills and abilities requiring involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, the professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education Russian National Research Medical University named after N.I. Pirogov.
N.I. Pirogova, the head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for the Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand illegally exported artifacts from the country.
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return about 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country through smuggling.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat television channel by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaoud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
"Only this year, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawaad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Now the department employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon returning, cultural values will be restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4th where a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the work of art was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor. ---
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and was not put up for auction since 1985.
It is unknown how the relic ended up in Europe.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally exported ancient artifacts in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, because Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are only united by the Turkic language group.
Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices.
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The thing is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse does not officially comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was productive in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the poet's earthly existence and his "ego". ---
He is already outside of any literary associations, he spat with imagism, he is himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes severely criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are true masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegova" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
The main success was that in the end of June 25th, Gosizdat concluded an agreement with Esenin for the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet has been honored like Sergei Alexandrovich, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - the fee under the contract was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the plant director received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed that year more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstoy, and had to arrange the family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is predominantly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Esenin's death) had materialized.
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling or not.
Over the empty and deserted field,
Is it like a grove in September?
Alcohol is raining brains.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin looked very weak, poorly, and obviously sick.
More and more often there are lulls, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Aleksandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, those related to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Dunkan, was treated for his health at a clinic near Paris by Professor Peter Gannushkin (Esenin would again come to him two years later, already in Moscow).
As for the evidence of the poet's binges, scandals on this soil, and calls to the police, there are plenty - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake has rapidly developed.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly stayed with his friend, the imagist Ivan Starcev.
Incredibly, despite Esenin's very decent income, he never had his own housing in either Moscow or St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, hotels or with friends.
Starcev remembers:
He only came to spend the night, and in most cases in an incoherent, drunk state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the stair landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
After coming to his senses a little, he began to cough continuously, spraying the sheet with blood...
Even Esenin himself, after his tour of Europe and the United States (there was Prohibition in the States at the time, but Dungan had brought a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I saw nothing there except taverns and streets..."
I'm already at the end and stopped remembering people...
Well, and drank, of course...
I drank because melancholy gnawed at me.

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom Mattress 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern interpretation of a budget model in the premium class line.
The basis of the mattress is a block of independent double springs Duet.
A smaller, softer spring is inserted inside the larger spring.
This allows for a uniform distribution of the load on the mattress.
The mattress is supplemented with artificial latex on both sides.
This is an analogue of natural latex, but it is denser and cheaper.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress will be perfect for a couple with a significant difference in weight (from 30 kilograms).
Thanks to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect when the light partner rolls to the side of the heavy one.
The pleasant, soft to the touch Sense jacquard case is sewn with a layer of synthetic padding.
Natural fabric does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this mattress model in a rolled-up version (vacuum roll-packing).
Now my son is almost 16, and he no longer has the desire to smoke.
All the energy is directed towards choosing what he will earn a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had periodic problems with the law until his wedding.
The father cares for his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love".
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't even failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that this is not a school.
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
He will retake the exam.
Millions of students know this.
What is the talk about anyway?
The Polish MFA believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU.
The Polish MFA considers that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon".
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Pawel Jablonski, expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively looking for new ways."
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons in many parts of the world.
As kp.ru wrote, the European Union previously implemented the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk has introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that have previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
At the 2021 social events, velvet jackets dominated.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashionable solution was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bond" bow tie.
Following his example, Prince William twice followed, first wearing a green velvet jacket that did not comply with the royal dress code for the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then choosing a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend tried on itself and Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up his seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
Incidentally, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the analysts of the service, received by "Gazeta.Ru", they began to be purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose velvet suits less often.
They can be bought not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next, and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are represented by almost all brands this season - both Brioni and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desired model is considered to be Gucci, in which one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House" was attended by the brand ambassador Jared Leto. ---
When choosing expensive brand jackets, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interweaving threads, a dense fabric with a velvety outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less accordingly.
Fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin from Lamoda warns that with a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is perfect if you are going to a party or a formal event," explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable for cases where the invitation specifies a dress code of "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion that allows you to choose a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first and foremost, should acquire a proper advanced social circle with enough wealth, - the authors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion "Handsome Brammel" believe. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets."
They are simply invited to scheduled social events where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with equally fashionable items: classic pants with arrows, solid-colored shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Handsome Brammella" are sure: it will be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate event, but if we are talking about a "leader among those who fuel this event, then - yes, such a thing is appropriate for him".
If the employee is of a lower rank and his goal is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to earn financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely evaluate this phrase with the phrase "not according to Senka's hat," say the editors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feelings from the voice.
This is an unnatural tone, so rehearsed.
And it is not associated at all with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you success in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well-lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they in sorrow?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also not in demand - both gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold now.
There is a high demand for fuel.
A penny is dripping.
And who is in flight then?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, it is not necessary to consider Western politicians as idiots who have "missed" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a decent fee.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the framework of the average passenger.
It is possible that if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then they will not sit down with such people, most likely.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave status and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not realize his slavery and languishes in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
The slave, whose saliva flows when he boasts of the charms of slave life and praises his good and kind master, is a flatterer and a sycophant.
The immunologist stated that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus.
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
Immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov made such a statement, calling the vaccination six months later, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period".
"With the previous strains, such a term was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four," said the expert, calling for parallel vaccination campaigns to be carried out. revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early vaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has received two vaccines and a booster, or has been sick and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and then sick, then they have developed "hybrid immunity", meaning they have a lot of neutralizing antibodies," the expert clarified.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia of "massive consequences" in case of an invasion of Ukraine.
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) have published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that "Russian military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will be expensive" for Moscow, but specific measures are not described in the document.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's escalating military power and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
Next, the ministers call on Russia to "ease escalation, use diplomatic channels, and fulfill its international obligations on military transparency," as President Biden said during a video call with President Putin on December 7.
"We confirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with the aim of resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the G7 also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response, they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response, - the statement also says.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, stated that Russia will face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "a united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia".
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective than the omicron-strain.
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicroon strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than other types of illness.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease course in case of coronavirus infection.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the impact of the omikron-strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron-strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking NATO arms deliveries to Kiev.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel, of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov reminded that last month Germany imposed a veto on the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and guns for the destruction of drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France are mentioned.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the issue of allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, said that Kiev should not expect arms deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous German government explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of escalating the military conflict in Donbass, despite the "Russian occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain and with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," added the president.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic and spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

The ways of returning stolen money through online stores have been revealed.
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses when a bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be put on a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend opening a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure protective technology, it is possible to initiate a refund procedure.
"According to the rules established by payment systems, responsibility for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure lies with the participant in the payment chain who does not use this service," said a representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to file a statement with the bank to challenge a fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition to this, if the criminal used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be protested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the funds to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss the "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation.
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream 2".
Although Scholz claimed about his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed clear expectations of each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, has stated that he will be calling on Scholz to speak out against the "North Stream 2" pipeline, which is intended to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has announced that it will help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disagreements.
The European Court has fined Poland for establishing that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party "Law and Justice" violate EU legislation.
Poland has refused to pay the fine and its highest court has ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not taken on any public obligations to stop the "Nord Stream 2" in case of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told members of Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany on stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a high-ranking US Congress staff member said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed these reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday about the consequences if Russia violates the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the "Big Seven".

Let everything be good for them.
It always surprises me when people write about means to wash the sink, toilet, windowsills, and faucets.
You wash them once a year on Easter, or something, that you have to wash right away.
Just don't let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Culture wants to give writers residencies.
The future Support Fund for Russian writers will be transferred federal property inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the Literary Fund of the USSR.

According to Doctor Tokarev, citizens believe in dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are such citizens who, a week before vaccination, start taking anticoagulants on their own initiative.
And during the pre-vaccination examination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars.
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the American state of Texas will be paid a reward.
This is reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians are in for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of packets of money and checks under the insulation.
He handed over the church's find and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say: "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
"We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quotes him.
It seems that the find is related to the theft that occurred in the Lakewood church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks stored in the church safe disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Kowli could not claim this amount because the award's validity period has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated a reward of five thousand dollars and later received another twenty thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
It was previously reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.

RTHK radio station reported this, citing a notice from Hong Kong's health authorities, TASS reports.
A 68-year-old resident of the urban district of Huai'an in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry at home, was infected with the infection.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports upon entry into the country.
In Brazil, it is now mandatory to require a covid passport from those entering the country, according to a ruling by Judge Luis Roberto Barroso of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF).
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are individuals who have arrived from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," said Barrozo.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists infected with the coronavirus to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme for complete protection from COVID-19 has been revealed.
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein revealed the scheme for complete protection from coronavirus infection in an interview with Ura.ru.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and applying nasal vaccine.
When used intra-nasally, a large number of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is injected, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the organism.
After vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies) formed inside.
And if you get both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulin A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief epidemiologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help those who in this case the body's defense, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseynov, stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Anna, hmm...
I used to talk to the dog (who has long since died) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, food, affection, love and games for a bitch in heat, then go ahead.
But the parrot was trained and generally smart.
My society chose and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It's not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they wouldn't run after the dog, even though they heard that 200,000 people were running away (from Pomsk), I took them by the hand and led them in a different direction.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the little dog that ran somewhere there.
Mass protests against vaccination opponents continue in Europe.
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February of next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the government's policy in the field of healthcare, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters with the inscription "This is a false pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A large protest action against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In an autonomous community, a covid-certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife establishments.
The authorities of a number of regions of the country have decided to introduce sanitary passports against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters demonstrated against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the guards.
The group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.

The WHO has already detected "omicron" in sixty states.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that the new coronavirus strain "omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it only began to spread actively at the end of November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rates of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
The WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the "delta" strain in terms of spread, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which currently leads in all countries without exception.
The World Health Organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously stated that the Omikron strain is capable of significantly impacting the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
The same conclusions were also reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "Omikron" will replace "Delta" in the coming months.
The number of those infected in Britain alone will be around 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially "Omikron" is currently sick in the Kingdom of several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron" strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be transported to hospitals daily.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of illness.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to "omicron" - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "Omikron" strain.

Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment on Bolshaya Zelenina still supports communication to this day.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to maintain warm relations with the older generation.
Maybe it's related to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented out, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more often at funerals.

Russians were warned about a new scheme of fraudsters.
Criminals have started looking for new ways to commit fraud in video messages.
This is written by "Izvestia" with a reference to experts.
According to the director of products at Ivideon, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deepfakes. ---
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfake, criminals can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution with the aim of blackmail.
"Such counterfeits can easily trigger bullying, as a cunning perpetrator can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," said the expert.
The leading system engineer at Varonis, Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this can create specific risks in the case of technologies using video.
David, I will add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality did not allow much makeup and short skirts, showing stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, both Muslim women wore makeup and showed their legs.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but there is no such cosmetics.
Five actions are listed that will help avoid diabetes.
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a key role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to regular water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products raise the level of sugar in the blood to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts recommend sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet not only helps to lose weight, but also protects against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, it is necessary to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about "migraine of the day off" in workaholics.
Several factors can lead to a worsening of well-being on weekends.
The cause of the deterioration of well-being after working days is often "migraine of the day off", said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research fellow of the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, scientific supervisor of the clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, especially often suffer from this workaholics, who on weekends have headaches, weakness and fatigue.
Doctor Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated fatigue over the week, there are plenty of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the organism to changes in conditions.
On weekends, our life changes fundamentally.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. "Due to the lack of coffee, a small break begins."
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and fragmentation.
An additional role is played by a late rise.
So, if you stand up three hours later than usual, a reaction called jetlag will occur.
She arises among travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in deteriorating health, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on weekends.

South African scientists have announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikron".
In South Africa, they announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against "Omikrona".
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omikron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "Omikron") corresponds to the level of vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... raises doubts about the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, - the study text published on the MedRxiv portal says.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from severe disease progression.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omikron strain of the coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in familiar products?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
His excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the product composition may be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in terms of calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names, essentially denoting sugar.
One of the most common and often encountered names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to monosaccharides and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient is called in the product composition - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: gas will lose importance for FRG in 25 years.
The new Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, has stated that the import of gas is losing importance for Germany as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"In other words, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as it is currently an important resource for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States had made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Berbok, stated that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, during the coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline does not currently "meet the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers hacked the Twitter account of the Prime Minister of India.
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The criminals managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment, and that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
In the office of Modi, they asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The page of the Prime Minister of India has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations to a fund using cryptocurrency.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
The third referendum in New Caledonia, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to preliminary results announced on Sunday, December 12 at noon, the majority of residents of New Caledonia voted against independence in the referendum.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against it.
The turnout was 43.90%, more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia participated in the elections.
As France-Presse agency comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence called on voters not to participate in the voting.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 on the archipelago hinders a full and "fair" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
As the separatists stated, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, President of France Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak on the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major topic in the recent weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of keeping the territory as part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean".
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valery Pekress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, calling on Catalans to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position because "it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex expressed a "strong desire" for the choice of Catalans to be the choice of France.

After passing the relevant tests, the UAV should be put into service with the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article on Russia-US relations.
The readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrifices Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and makes a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell, he called on Western countries to "stand together against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is a lot of false information in this article," - RIA Novosti quotes a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land."
"The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," said another.

An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin producing new generation of reactive drones.
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, they will begin to create ANKA type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
This was reported on December 11 by an external adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Alexey Arrestovich.
That is, they are capable of acting against air objects, against other drones.
Even against piloted aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish avionics: the fuselage and the like," Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA drones, Arestovich said that these are reactive, not piston-powered UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the factory at the end of next year, concluded Arestovich.
The ANKA flying machine was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the authorities of Turkey in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of joint military operations in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a modern military drone factory had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a training center in Kiev Oblast for personnel training, testing, and servicing of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called the memorandum a "big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport.
In Singapore's Changi Airport, lions have escaped.
The Straits Times reports this.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective fence installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of Mandai Wildlife Group employees at the airport, who are in charge of all Singaporean zoos.
They paralyzed the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
It was previously reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
The same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not harmed.
Specialists warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9.
Studies show that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to specialists, there is strong evidence that people who do not have a deficiency of folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose on the contrary promotes the growth of cancer cells.
The University of Alabama in Birmingham professor and dietitian Bet Kitchin advises to keep track of the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if there is a significant deviation from this number in either direction.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other food products that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Since it is contained in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75,000 people may die due to the Omikron strain.
British scientists' forecasts show that due to the spread of the Omikron-strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific and consultative group on emergency situations at the British cabinet of ministers, by April 2022, the country will record no fewer than 25,000 fatal outcomes due to the omicron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading the National Health Service if the Omikron strain proves more infectious than the Delta variant and existing vaccines cannot prevent infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the speed of the spread of the Omikron strain remains at its current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By the middle of December, the Omicroon strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1898 cases of infection with the Omicroon strain of the coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last day.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has increased in the world by a quarter.
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking records worldwide, despite calls to reduce carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the consequences of climate change, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $50 million or more will not decrease, writes "The Guardian".
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such excitement on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via zoom.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more just to have their yacht ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People simply crave freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
Sociologists say that the rich do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause irritation in society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that it will be extremely difficult to implement given the mobility of money.
Meanwhile, only the number of ordered super-yachts impresses, but also their characteristics.
Out of 1200 ships, 27 have a bow length of over 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Rake is building a 183-meter yacht REV Ocean.
After launching, this will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" and a submarine boat for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing super-yachts, helicopter platforms have become common, outdoor cinemas, and on some of them, such as the McGregor fighter's yacht, a platform for combat sports. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana, Richard Wilk, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance if we consider that there are slightly more than 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average planetary inhabitant.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
Meanwhile, two-thirds of the emission trail fell on his 162.5-meter yacht Eclipse.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the team continues to pollute the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
The owners of superyachts do not evoke sympathy from other people when, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, they complain on YouTube that there is no room for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol in a week increases the risk of cancer development.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Specialists have come to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more portions of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Furthermore, the risk of developing colon cancer is higher among moderate drinking men than among women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the organism.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child.
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they do not realize how developed four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out how animal intelligence has developed.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can consecutively respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in the Sciencealert edition.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they do not understand anything about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to deceive their owners.
Experts say that representatives of some breeds show the best results in understanding human language words, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and in terms of their ability to learn, they do not lag behind a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is ready for trade with the United States and Russia.
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication "Glavred".
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States regarding Ukraine's non-entry into the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not negotiate, but simply send the proposer away.
As for Ukraine, trade is expected, wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparation is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately moves on to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and counter-measures to be deployed," he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry.
Advanced Chinese technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Equipment and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in the city of Zhuzhou, Hunan Province / Central China/. ---
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said the company's representative, Hou Chaoven.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with data technologies that will provide increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the last six months, China has significantly increased its export of railway vehicles and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China were released from the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. They are intended for export to Europe.
At a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the subway train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the subway line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The movement along this subway line will be open next year.
This will be the fastest subway line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"The Chinese industry for the production of equipment for railway transport is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Fan Yao, head of the trade and investment department of the Chinese Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CCPIT/.
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment production in the global market," said Fan Yaojian.
After more than 60 years of intense work, conducting a series of independent research and development, China has created a leading system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaojian, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia.
The candidate of biological sciences, Semen Golosheikin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia. ---
According to him, the signs of future dementia may be forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion about the fact that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, said the specialist.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins. ---
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, studying foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic, said Golosheikin.
Earlier, a charitable organization for the study of dementia in the UK stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient has difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing weak-mindedness, specialists called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad.
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the consortium of doctors created by the Georgian ombudsman.
His neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
"Stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, and variable character," said the specialist, noting that this does not exceed the normative boundaries and that the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia," said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to boycott the receipt of medical assistance after being subjected to disciplinary punishment by penitentiary service employees.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID-passports took place in Spain.
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, according to Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes, and nightlife establishments.
Many manifestants came to the action without masks.
Their slogans on their posters accused the government of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required for entry into entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
The protesters in this city have claimed a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted draft laws on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities by presenting either a vaccination or disease certificate, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for train and plane trips.

Steep climb: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to engage in winter sports, which will allow the collection of the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of remote and underdeveloped provinces.
The ski resort in Chuanzhuo, Taiwan, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese people.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, work is also being carried out on landscaping: workers are planting trees.
The country has more than 700 ski resorts, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiajie, where resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide comfortable and interesting rest on Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still far away.
The organization adviser for the Games, Justin Downs, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese people are sent to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still have to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
70-year-old Gao Ma Kong lives in Chunli, not far from the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chuni, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
In the country, more and more stores are opening that sell clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Food points with national cuisine dishes are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwan.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, the WHO said.
More than 500 million people in the world may be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress in the matter of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) have said.
In connection with the marked December 12th World Health Organization and World Bank published two complementary reports on universal health coverage.
They stated that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive strain on health care systems.
In this connection, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population by immunization has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WB emphasized that the pandemic has caused the "worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes over 500 million people "into extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have virtually no social support.

Taiwan's minister was cut off from the "Summit for Democracy" broadcast at the request of the White House.
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technologies, Audrey Tang, at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into a video-free mode, according to the summit's YouTube recording.
The Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to their statement, the cause was a map in which Taiwan was highlighted in a different color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Mrs. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries in the world according to the degree of protection of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted on it in green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam - in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Sources from Reuters note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could be in conflict with the "one China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The "Summit for Democracy" organized by Washington took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate summit, the editor-in-chief of "Novaya Gazeta" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, the deputy secretary of the Russian Federation's Sovbez, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".
They give you information as if they are cooking food, and there is always stale meat everywhere, in fact, the meat remains with the butcher until the last piece.
The classics of journalism - create news from nothing.
They are not brewing meat, but horns and hooves, obtaining a substance like glue.
The finished product looks like a yellow semi-transparent strip with almost no smell and is hard, like plastic, and is used as a natural gelatin.
Generally, there are no fewer harmful substances from recycling waste than from its decomposition.
But this saves companies huge amounts of money.
Therefore, a fairy tale about ecology for fools was invented, who will also work on garbage collection for free for the idea.
Personally, my contribution to ecology is to refuse to buy unnecessary things and use them for a long time.
If I go beyond the limits - I do not throw away, but give to charity.

Write that they are "scoundrels, did not return the money".
But how many and when they have children, it's none of your business, until they decide to hang those children around your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Probably, it is only in education that such a thing is possible.
The chosen (self-evident) parents dictate their own rules, openly ignoring the existing ones.
And if this will also apply to other spheres of life, the judiciary and etc.?
For them, the laws are not written.

The joint mechanism for prevention and control of the State Council of China has issued a circular requiring intensified prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land border crossing points are located in order to prevent further importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the specified cities must provide a negative result of the COVID-19 nucleic acid test obtained within 48 hours of departure.
Those who come to cities where land border crossing points are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities, up to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities where land border crossing points are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said there was a "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States.
The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Ryabkov, assessed the prospects for Moscow's relations with Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some improvement in relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the long journey we have taken with the current administration, Trump, and Obama.
"The problems started not yesterday," - indicated the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose its approaches on Russia on a range of issues.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not risk making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and did not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, except for such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress is observed.
Russia is calling on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned of the danger of vaccinating with a nasal COVID vaccine outside the hospital.
Those who have been vaccinated with the intranasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop an allergy and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
It is easier to organize vaccination points with nasal vaccines in airports and shopping centers, but I would only do this in medical institutions at first.
The thing is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit near the doctor's office after that. ---
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which can sometimes be very useful," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when there is experience in using the drug.
He also emphasized that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a probability that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person sneezes after injection while their nose is congested.

Lama, they say, truly believing people make up the church.
We cannot know whether there are truly believing ones or not.
Each of us would like to be a truly believing one, and everyone tries to be it.
But no one should speak about themselves or about those who believe the same as they do, that they are the only true believers.
Because if they can say about themselves that they are truly believers, then others can say the same thing.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the Omicroon-strain of the coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT in Russian.
In the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new Omicroon strain of the coronavirus have been identified in the past 24 hours.
Sky News reports on this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "Omikron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people became ill with a new variant of the infection in Scotland, and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the "omicron" strain, up to 75,000 people may die.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions.
The press secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer oneself," said the official representative of the Kremlin on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this."
It was previously reported that the US is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles to dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

The residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France.
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave the French territory.
This was reported by French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
Against independence, 96.5% of those who voted spoke out.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The level of participation in the voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to refrain from participating in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the residents supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia as its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
There is an agreement from 1998 between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a two-year difference.

The WHO initially considers "omicron" to be less dangerous than "delta".
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily considers that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta-strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "Omikron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the "Omikron" strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant."
According to preliminary estimates from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with "delta", - says the WHO technical message.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of "omicron" infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than "deltas".
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron-strain have been registered.
They "were previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named.
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadym Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may lose Western support, and may also compromise on Donbass.
Denisenko told about this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm," assumes that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, prices for key goods that we traditionally export are decreasing, internal protests and opposition to the government from key FPGs (financial-industrial groups) are increasing," added the former parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against everyone".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on Donbass, as a result of which there may be opposition within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's positions will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the words of the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between groups of the population who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which may lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During this variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting of power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into "the father of the nation".
This can be caused by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be sufficiently large-scale to elicit a reaction from external partners and increase support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the former deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any probabilities of an "attack" on Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest indicator since his election as head of state.
Analysts have predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for former President Petro Poroshenko. ---
Among all those surveyed, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thank you to the author for the story about the great athlete, I did not know that Elena Shushunova had died, it is very sad to learn this.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul, for us, residents of the Primorsky Territory, it was a live broadcast, real time. ---
Such a surge of passions, emotions were overwhelming, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy with the other victories, as they cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all Soviet athletes at the time.
I saw a documentary on one of the Central American countries on TV somehow, and there watermelons were rolled down the ramp onto the ship's deck like barrels.
The watermelons were of monstrous size.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on the cleaning and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and have not met watermelons weighing more than a pood.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the vine and not earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color: beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article: 12008).
A balconette bra with soft lace cups on frames.
The bottom part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The inner side of the cup, in the area of the strap attachment, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the decollete and under the chest.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to curl on large sizes.
I really didn't like the article, it was mean and poisonous.

The arrested poet for the action on Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtushenko, 10 days are given, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetvrossiibol'shechempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander for a repeat violation of the order for conducting a public action under an administrative article.
He was arrested for the first time on January 23rd on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of culture in general in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to more fully reveal the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you during this and previous detentions?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?

At public and official events, they speak in the language of the surrounding people so that everyone understands what happened in Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.

Researchers have told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that improve blood circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help to function the systems of the organism.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Thanks to the high content of chitin, it is useful for the digestive tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, not fried in oil.
Earlier, the Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other products with a high glycemic index.
These are products with carbohydrate content that are quickly broken down into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in their production in private subsidiary households and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current production deficit can only be compensated by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the "Yandex" search results. ---
Candidates for departure
In 2015, the rights holders from the "RAEK / Media" cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites in the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Calamari" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest video service in Russia, ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search results, you can watch the animated novelty "Enkanto", but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the film shot in the cinema).
The series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available on Filmix, which can also be found through search engines. ---

A wide circle, surrounded by "molecules" of light, provides the most uniform and bright lighting of the space.
"Atomic" or "molecular" design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each object, remains relevant and allows for advantageous accentuation in interior design.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is the weightlessness of the construction.

Dimaax Micro Ultimate Mattress, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two different surfaces in terms of softness - high hardness and slightly higher than average.
The product includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model, an independent spring block "micro-package" is installed.
This means that 2000 springs come to the sleeping place, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides unique point-by-point adjustment.
"Micro-package" is the highest frequency of all the variety of spring blocks "Dimax", so it has a clearly pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long been carrying the status of classic, as it not only gives the mattress orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the corset provides proper support for the spine, then latex adapts the surface to the human body.
The case: the model is supplied in a knitted Aloe Vera case.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam, which is used in the mattress, has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, reported "Actual Camera" on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the suitability for life of Venus's clouds, and then search for life there.
For the Tartu project, scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in Venus's clouds.
It was previously thought that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of the Earth type.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If it differs, then it is possible that the more likely scenario will be that life originated on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mikkel Pajusalu.

Metaworlds will change Russian business.
The topic of meta-universes became popular last fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, like everywhere else in the world, will invest in creating its own meta-settlements and their subsequent monetization.
Metaworlds should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too greasy and harmful.
Of course, we will have both traditional olivier and herring under a fur coat for the holiday, but no one is forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can eat by the spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
Indeed, there are ten weekends ahead, you can prepare any delicious and healthy dishes.

The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022.
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes that such attempts will fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, followed by inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in prices for goods is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that "the world of central banks' endless generosity has already lived itself out" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the background of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department of "Otkrytie Investment" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 are preserved, but the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar course, Shulgin named the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices, and concerns against the background of the coronavirus pandemic.
I am forced to agree.
But one thing pleases: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.

Russians gave car dealers around 4.5% of the country's GDP. ---
As of the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than for the same period last year, according to data from the Russian Automotive Market Research agency. ---
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
At the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization member states in September, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of income on the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the previous year.
The relative Kia brand Hyundai has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions, this brand also increased the average weighted price of the car - over the year, Hyundai's price increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had stronger price increases.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not grown as significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than the previous year.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Toyota completes the top three leaders in terms of sales volume in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Mercedes-Benz follows the Japanese with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has seen both sales volume (up 37%) and the average price of a car (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles) increase.
"Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing good sales growth and an average weighted price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater financial capacity, explained the CEO of NAPI Tatyana Arabadji."
Chinese brands are demonstrating fantastic sales growth rates, also significantly increasing their financial capacity this year.
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months.
At the level of last year, companies with financial capacity are those whose car sales in units in 2021 have fallen: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in the minus - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions affecting the global automotive industry, car companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite the price tags on their products and other automakers.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car deficit, inflation also contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to make up for past losses, experts say.
In the context of a car shortage, I think many car manufacturers were able to partially shift the costs of previous periods onto consumers, which they were unable to include in the price of cars earlier.
"says the analyst of VTB Capital for the automotive industry, Vladimir Bespalov."
I assume that in terms of finance, car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, supporting high margin sales.
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of car prices, which have been observed throughout 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, according to the expert.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantity and in money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the construction of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As the supply increases, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in car prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to generate income from volumes, says independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to maximize profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliev.
It is not expected that the volume of car production will increase at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is heated up even more by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, an expert says.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US military to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion.
The US leadership never considered sending American military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
With this statement, President Joe Biden spoke.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, answering a journalist's question about whether the US has abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to defend Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops in a one-sided manner for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the US will redeploy forces to NATO's Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO forces to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia" - Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intentions of invading Ukraine's territory.
At the same time, he indicated that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".

The Russian film "Squeezing Fists" nominated for an Oscar has won the European Film Academy award (also known as the "European Oscar") in the "Best Editing" category, according to the Moscow Komsomolets.
The jury of the competition, which voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the film's creators.
The maximum number of awards was received this time by the film "Where Are You Going, Aida?" by Jasmina Žbanić (Bosnia).
The main heroine of the film is a translator for the UN mission who tries to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama "Unclenching Fists", directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov's workshop), it tells the story of the complex relationships between a domineering father and his children who want to break free from his control in North Ossetia.
It was previously announced that this film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
As regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, I think you are, to put it mildly, not on topic.
