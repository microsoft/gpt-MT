At the annual academic meeting of Zhejiang University, students sing the leading role, and the research results are brain-opening-Xinhuanet
Use air to wash hands, breathe to judge diseases, and accurately search for the source of smog Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic annual conference of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, covering the environment, machinery, energy, medical care, life sciences, humanities education and other major fields, students started from a curious idea, created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your home medical examiner
The team of Diming Zhang, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biosensor on a smartphone end, half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale lightly, and this set of instruments can initially detect the health of the body from the composition of the gas you exhale. ”
Zhang Diming said that this set of sensors is connected to a smartphone, and after exhaling a breath, the health report will be displayed on the mobile phone.
Smart bracelets on the market that can detect health conditions generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material, which targets chemical elements, and its keen "sense of smell" allows it to reflect the health of the body more deeply and accurately.
Smart surgical light: high-energy eyes for doctors
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won a silver medal at this year's 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, master's students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented intelligent LED surgical shadowless lights.
"The early detection and resection of many diseases is not in place, which is related to the lamps used in the doctor's operating room. ”
Shen Junfei said, for example, during the early detection of cancer, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, then the cancer cells will spread later.
This smart surgical light has four light plates that adjust the spectrum to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowlessness of the spot at any time according to the needs of surgery and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Run Run Shaw Hospital affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and has received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won first prize in the National Challenge Cup.
Wash your hands with air: water efficient and cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most wipe some soap and squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air handwashing devices".
Just by standing on the device's handwashing station, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and binds with the water.
In this way, we can wash our hands! ”
Color reaction and bacterial residue experiments have proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary hand washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as a drive, which can not only ensure the degree of cleaning, but also save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-free, energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention stood out among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold medal.

Okay, trouble
A certificate that I find very meaningful - first aid certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think is important in addition to my driver's license!
Popularize: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time in the process of ambulance coming after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid is needed.
If I do have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, respiratory arrest, then the window of our life is only four minutes, four golden minutes!
So the people around you know how important first aid is!
When someone around us falls, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, instead of standing there stupidly and doing nothing, this feeling of helplessness is too terrifying.
"In China, our official figures show that three million people die unexpectedly every year, the most dangerous of which is cardiac arrest.
In the United States, an average of 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 780 percent can be saved, compared with less than 1 percent in Shanghai and Beijing. ”
This is what Lu Le, the founder of First Reaction, said.
If a person goes into cardiac arrest, there is no breath, there is no heartbeat, you have no effect in pinching.
Rescue breaths and chest compressions must be done to save people.
I found that very few of us now have this awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe it can save a person's life!
First aid certificates can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goal to be completed before the age of 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was also a few months ago, but it is indeed completed!
Then I have to go to test for other certificates that I want to take, and I plan to take a diving certificate, before I saw in Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate, it seems that you have to have a first aid certificate to take the test, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER #

First of all, the conclusion, I personally think that "Four Seas" is an all-round bad film, in every sense.
But if you want to say whether this movie is a bright spot, then it's not at least the soundtrack is very good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, so that you can fall asleep in the cinema is counted as one, and the one that makes you indignant after watching it is also counted, "Four Seas" is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation in a grammatic novel, indescribable, and has many loopholes like a trench coat on Pony.
Even after reading it, you will wonder if there is a metaphor implied by the director, but when you think about it, you find that it is actually a piece of.
Let's start with some plots that are difficult for me to understand.
The male protagonist should live on a small island in the south, and he and his grandmother depend on each other.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, and then the plot arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive her to the northeast to see the snow.
Elderly people in a van from the south to the northeast to see the snow ??
He and his dad were still very relieved about this.
Then the old man was gone.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship, how did the heroine and her brother get a business license?
Why can the island speeding party gangsters easily close a section of mountain road?
Then the truck delivering the steel bar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, and even the truck driver could not be found around.
This prop sense is also too obvious.
Why would a gangster speeding party with bad credit and suspected violations become an auxiliary policeman?
In the face of usury, why don't you call the police, the police in the movie also specifically asked if there was any difficulty?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but does not know how to open the door with a room card in a hotel, and then forcibly arranges to find the innkeeper and sit outside the room door to sleep overnight?
This inexplicable plot pervades the entire film, and because the plot is so outrageous that it pains me when I recall them.
In addition to the plot, what is worse is the theme of the movie, or the theme of the movie at all, which is an abomination stitching monster.
At the beginning of the film, you will think that he wants to make a comedy, more than 20 minutes later you guess it may be an inspirational film, when you watch half of it you think it may be a feature film that wants to reflect the difficulty of survival of young people in a small town, after watching it, you don't know what you watched, followed by deep doubts about yourself, why run to the cinema to enjoy the poop in the New Year.
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the routines of various movies, such as if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, then inspirational + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented rookie is successful step by step.
If you want to make a romance movie, then you can honestly talk about the grudge between small-town youth and waiter girls who like to ride motorcycles.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot must not appear in something contrary to the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng's role that the new motorcycle has just been burned and can still sing), he can't open some brain holes that even Kennedy can't stand watching it.
As for the heroine, she is obviously not mentally handicapped, but in some ways she behaves like a 5-year-old child, I really don't know if this is the reason for acting skills or the director's requirements.
Another point I can't understand, why is Han Han, as a racing driver, so keen to add crash plots to his own movies?
Is such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival file to add congestion to the audience?

Chongqing Secondary Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship System Admission is the prospective employee of the enterprise-Xinhuanet
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools, and the students who receive the pilot training also have the status of apprentices, and after enrollment and entry, they will be pre-recorded as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and admission procedures of secondary vocational schools and enterprise employment be standardized, and the dual identity of secondary vocational school students and prospective employees of enterprises be clarified, and that in accordance with the principle of two-way selection, apprentices, schools and enterprises sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, an agreement must be signed by the four parties of the apprentice, guardian, school and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and protection of rights and interests of the apprentices on the job.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship systems and jointly carry out pre-job training and transfer training for employees of enterprises with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
The school and enterprise jointly design the talent training program, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, post standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot takes the training system as a pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent training plan, and the top internship is generally 6 months.
According to the characteristics of different majors, 1 master can bring 2~5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has identified 60 pilot projects of the municipal secondary vocational modern apprenticeship system in three batches, each with a pilot number of about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of first piloting and then implementing, and gradually advancing from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint enrollment, joint training and integrated education, effectively improve students' job skills, and improve students' counterpart employment rate and employment quality.

South African doctor: Although Omicron is highly transmissible, it is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the Omicron variant spread in South Africa, a physician organization of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the new crown patients they are currently treating have mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the group's director, said he sees dozens of patients a day, but none yet need to be hospitalized.
"They were able to manage the disease at home and most recovered within 10 to 14 days of quarantine," Pillay said. ”
This includes older patients and those with health problems who would otherwise be more likely to fall into severe illness from coronavirus infection, he said.
In contrast, he said, in the last wave of the Delta outbreak, he treated COVID patients "had trouble breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many will be hospitalized within days."
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of the new crown patients hospitalized in recent weeks are seriously ill, half of the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave of the epidemic; The average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of recent COVID patients have died, compared with 20% of cases in the early outbreak in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Institute, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports that said: "At the moment, almost all indications are that this is a milder disease . ”
He added: "It's still early days and we need to get late-stage data.
Typically, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we entered this wave for only two weeks. ”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effects of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta remains the dominant strain of the coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa at the epicenter.
Gauteng saw a 400 per cent increase in new cases detected in the first week of December, with tests showing that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90 per cent of cases, according to health officials.
Thanks to today's supporters, all 80 boxes were given away!

Education Review: What does it take to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service slogan "no sale, no killing", then in a good environment where there is no demand for "trafficking", mass prevention and mass management, and the whole people countering trafficking, making trafficking unprofitable, risky, and costly, such crimes will not occur repeatedly.
Recently, the platform for the emergency release of missing children developed by the Anti-Trafficking Office of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security was launched.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly recover abducted children.
Hearing that this app is called "Reunion", I suddenly felt warm.
The new technological means are not only called "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also properly used by informationization, practical and effective.
The primary goal of law enforcement against trafficking is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed in many "big words".
However, before a trafficking case is solved, priority attention should be paid to the victim's personal safety.
Under the urgent purpose of "seeking help", controversial topics such as "whether child abduction and trafficking should be the death penalty" can be put on hold and discussed cautiously; However, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Based on the experience of investigating such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the place of crime as soon as possible after success.
If the abduction operation is delayed for one minute, the child may be one step further away from the parent, and the difficulty of solving the case will increase by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic action to come up with such an effective method as the "reunion" platform that directly helps to solve the case and recover the child.
After all, "cracking down on abduction" is a major task that requires the operation of the entire legal system to do a good job.
To combat crime and protect the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of the judiciary, and the meticulous enforcement of the law, there is no need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three rested at a train station, and the parents fell asleep, only to wake up to find that the child was gone.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, it should be at least reasonably protective conscious.
Taking turns for both parents to rest, or placing the child under secure protection, is the least a measure of preventing a child from being abducted.
From the other side of the police's crackdown on trafficking crimes, the party who buys the abducted child should also be paid attention to and punished.
Individual wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to China's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of child abduction and trafficking is 5 years; If the circumstances are particularly serious, they may be sentenced to death and confiscation of property.
With a high starting point and a maximum penalty, the crime of child abduction and trafficking is obviously a crime with a heavier punishment under the general trend of "light sentences".
However, there are still many trafficking cases every year.
It can be seen that some people have backward concepts in raising children and have weak legal awareness.
Legal education for these people should be followed up simultaneously.
To effectively control trafficking crimes, we cannot rely solely on strict official law enforcement.
If the "market" for trafficking is widespread, traffickers are motivated by profit, and they continue to innovate trafficking methods, forming a situation of "fighting the law" with law enforcers, the anti-trafficking operation is bound to fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking down backward concepts and popularizing legal knowledge will also help eradicate the crime of abducting and buying children.
Yang Haodong preached the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the provincial party congress in Malanshan
Draw forging strength from the party's century-long history of struggle
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All-media reporter Gong Baiwei) According to the unified arrangement of the provincial party committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department of the provincial party committee, gave an interactive lecture at the Malanshan Video Cultural and Creative Park, deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, studying and implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and instructions on Hunan's important speech, and studying and implementing the spirit of the 12th provincial party congress.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), five grades.
Virgin olive oil, or natural olive oil, is a fat obtained by removing foreign matter by mechanical cold pressing and filtration directly from fresh olive fruit.
According to the acidity, it can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Extra Virgin): The highest grade and highest quality olive oil, is a purely natural product.
Excellent taste, with a light and pleasant botanical aroma, acidity of no more than 1%.
Fine Virgin: slightly more acidic, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary virgin olive oil: Fair taste and flavor, no more than 3.3% acidity.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after refining virgin olive oil with an acidity of more than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
Refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: Refined olive oil is mixed with a certain proportion of virgin olive oil to harmonize taste and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, and it is a transparent light golden yellow.
Refined olive impurity oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): Olive oil extracted from oil residue by dissolution method and refined after refining.
If you have read the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olive fruit is like the grapes that make wine, and olive fruits from different production areas and different olive fruit varieties will produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climatic conditions for the growth of oil olives, such as air temperature, sunshine, air humidity and precipitation.
Except for the Mediterranean coast, sporadic cultivation can only be found in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and similar climates are Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on in the southern latitudes.
Months of harvesting of olives:
From March to June of each year, the olive tree blooms and sets fruit, and from July to October the fruit begins to develop and ripen, the fruit transitions from green to red, purple and finally black.
The fruit is harvested from November to February (olive oil freshness is very important).
Nutritional content of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil among the oils discovered so far.
The democracy summit ended, and Biden said that the flame of freedom will never be extinguished
The virtual Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden and attended by governments from 110 countries, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world, and authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said that he plans to hold the second global "democracy summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and political councilor Tang Feng, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in Britain, also spoke at the summit the following day.
"We know how hard the work ahead of us is," Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because I have said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Authoritarian regimes can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world. ”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the joint efforts of the entire society.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reform, achieve transparent and accountable governance, be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian power, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the common good," he said. ”
The themes of the second day of the Democracy Summit were to defend human rights, consolidate democracy and fight authoritarianism, and counter digital authoritarianism and affirm democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres also said in his opening speech that the cause of democracy is facing challenges around the world, especially those brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"It is time to reaffirm shared values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequalities, fighting corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. ”
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminding attendees of continued attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and China's ethnic minorities, including Uighurs and Tibetans.
"The world has long accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our priority. ”
Law also called on the free world to unite against the CCP threat.
"Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don't recognize the threat [to the CCP] to our democratic values," he said.
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change . ”
Tang Feng, political councilor of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, issued a "National Statement" via video during a roundtable discussion on "Combating Digital Authoritarianism and Affirming Democratic Values", emphasizing that Taiwan is at the forefront of the fight against autocracy and authoritarianism.
He also shared his experience on how to fight the pandemic through transparency and mutual trust.
"At a time when democracy in Taiwan is in its ascendant, we have always been at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and have played a leading role in promoting freedom, democracy and human rights around the world," he said.
Global democracy has shown signs of regression during the pandemic, authoritarian governments everywhere have justified human rights abuses in the name of public health and the collective good.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to take down the shelves to defeat disinformation. ”
On the second day of the Democracy Summit, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who were found to have committed serious human rights abuses, as well as investment restrictions on a Chinese company found to have used surveillance technology to assist human rights abuses.

Hello, the saliva chicken sent by the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't tell, then the expensive normal situation will be friendlier than the cheap racket, this kind of "entry shoot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very low, the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and it is difficult for the master to control.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult ———, I know if you can't learn it, and I know that you are not willing to buy expensive ones, make a bargain to fool you, you play twice, you will not play again, so that this racket is cheap, and you are not distressed.
When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means that you have improved, and when the time comes, come to me again to buy expensive ones, and I will earn money twice.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand racket, choose Prince, or Dunlop's, these two brands are not famous enough, so a good racket can not be sold at a price, the new auction 500, 600 is very good, second-hand 200 pieces, with a thousand yuan to enjoy the enjoyment is not fragrant?
It's friendly to newbies, but once it's past the novice stage, it's a chicken rib, but most people, especially girls, can't get past the novice stage.
The order has been delayed in delivery time several times

Girl as an arrow target to raise money for her sister: "It's okay to think that it is a flesh wound" - Xinhuanet
A girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words "Human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the wooden board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl willing to be an 'arrow target' to raise money for her sister" flooded the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl in Hangzhou's Wulin Square standing in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person, with the words "human target, ten yuan and one arrow" written on the board, signaling passers-by to use a bow and arrow to shoot after payment.
This behavior caused heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl had made such an aggressive move to raise funds for her sister, but this behavior was not worth advocating, and after being admonished, the girl had left the local police station yesterday.
Girls street "arrow target" fundraisers were admonished
In the online picture, a long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in the shape of a "one", with the words "human flesh target, ten yuan and one arrow" written in black ink, and her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers written on another wooden board in front of her.
The image sparked controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this move is "eye-catching begging behavior", and many netizens have expressed sympathy for this.
"We found out when we patrolled to the square at about 10 a.m. on the 23rd, and there were already many onlookers at that time. ”
In an interview with local media, the police of the Tianshui Police Station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stall, both about 20 years old, dressed young and beautiful.
Among them, the girl who made the "human target" has been crying, begging passers-by to play this game; Another girl was on the side to help shout, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and was in urgent need of surgery fees, so please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was collecting money for her sister's leukemia treatment. ”
Last night, the head of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl's name was Ji Jiali, and she raised funds for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, because the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds for a while, so he made this behavior.
He said that during the whole process, one of the two girls was used as a target and the other was responsible for shooting, but he did not participate in it, and no one was found shooting arrows during the whole process, but some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police determined that the bows and arrows used were not subject to control.
The person in charge said that "this kind of eyeball fundraising method is not advocated".
After being warned by the police station, she left the police station.

What is the hottest in 2021?
Undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win prizes?
Some time ago, there was an article "Look! The article "The Olympic project where the project manager can hit the gold medal" article is very popular, which mentions that project managers can definitely take the lead in many projects, and no one can match: Moving bricks, traveling on business, and staying up late are the daily life of project managers, and firefighting, backing, and apologizing are not a word.
An article that seems to be a joke and ridicule, but it also expresses the daily bitterness of project managers, and behind it represents the inability to do the current project management work.
People engaged in project management gradually choose to take some actions to get themselves out of the predicament at work.
Judging from the number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) registrations that climb every year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management capabilities.
According to the "Twenty Years of Development Report on Project Management in China (1999-2019)", as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP applicants nationwide was nearly 600,000, about 420,000 people passed PMP certification, and about 300,000 valid certificate holders, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP®®® certificates in the world.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP certificate holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer advisable to simply copy the "old experience" of the past, and the rapidly changing work environment tells us that we must learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the way forward.
However, does taking the PMP test ensure that the project management work is unimpeded?
Many project management beginners said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas of project management and the five major process groups and other related knowledge points, but they are still confused when they really carry out project management work.
Many project managers often report the following problems: project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, work can not be implemented, project estimation is not accurate, control sensitivity is poor, and the project is delayed again and again; The division of labor among the members is not clear, the "old fried sticks" in the team do not know how to deal with the cross-department assistance communication is not smooth, and the project is difficult to move forward ...
Therefore, focusing on the field of product innovation and R&D management for more than ten years, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of key R&D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base", came with the online course of "R&D Project Manager Training Camp".
"R&D Project Manager Training Camp" Online Course This is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advanced road of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers with lower costs and less investment, and bring efficient operational results to enterprises.
If you can't say anything, you can first see what other students say about this course: This course is not only composed of Zhongtian Huaxia expert team (formerly Huawei's R&D management team), combined with international advanced project management methodologies and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, but also provides in-depth and professional explanations of the course content.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, and rich template forms to help students transform the content they learn into specific work after class.

According to the results of the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" released by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index is 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
On the whole, Chinese residents perform well at the level of financial consumption, but they show great differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and it is necessary to further improve the level of basic financial knowledge.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and adolescents is relatively low, and "one old and one young" will continue to be the focus of financial education; Nielsen's "Report on the Debt Status of China's Young People" and CCTV Finance's "2019-2020 China Youth Consumption Report" show that the younger generation has huge consumption potential, credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption, 86.6% of young people are using credit products, nearly half of them have no debt accumulation, although the young generation overall presents a rational consumption trend, although it is very different from the label of "excessive squandering" on the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and follow-up consumption behavior. As a result, excessive financial pressure and debt risks have occurred, and even led to a gradual increase in social problems, financial enterprises should have the courage to assume social responsibilities and provide positive guidance.
As a licensed consumer financial institution, Home Credit has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives with high-quality and considerate services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct view of consumption, and actively responding to regulatory calls to enhance consumers' awareness of rational consumption, especially young people.
Over the past years, Home Credit has continuously carried out all-round and diversified financial literacy activities for young people, including college students, and has cooperated with top domestic universities to launch innovative practice competitions and other forms to subtly guide the consumption needs of young people, help them establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption needs, and help them accumulate life wealth.
On the occasion of Double 12, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish a reasonable sense of consumption and a correct view of money, resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and avoid misunderstandings of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, you must plan ahead and repay on time according to your means.
If it is overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may adversely affect the economic life such as buying a car and a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, you should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated and iterative financial products to bring consumers more suitable and diversified services, continuously help the public improve their financial knowledge, help consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate lending, and become a reliable consumer financial partner for life.

The Gulf Cooperation Council addresses common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
Notably, this is the first visit by Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed an embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups while maintaining close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have seriously affected the internal unity of the GCC and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries blocked land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the January 2021 GCC summit, when Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward "unity and stability" mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are spearheading efforts to restore relations with Qatar through the appointment of new ambassadors in Qatar.
The resolution of differences by the Gulf Arab states in order to restore relations with Qatar stems from the demand that they must unite for the benefit of all countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land passage between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor connecting the two countries will facilitate the mobility of citizens of both countries and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman, and companies from both countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion to work together.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and world powers to save the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal condemned by Gulf Arab states for finding it impossible to resolve the missile issue with Iran.
Gulf states have long viewed Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf States believe that failure to resolve the Iranian missile issue and to act to curb Iran's activities in the region is flawed.
Saudi Arabia entered into direct negotiations with Iran against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers to meet the aspirations of the Gulf states.
The goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth of the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first for GCC countries since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the GCC to reassess the results of its diplomacy that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the GCC, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in meeting common challenges and contributing to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Known as the loudest exhaust of supercars in Xinshan District!
This car brought to you by our team this time is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's successor – the Aventador LP700-4!
The asking price is nearly RM2 million, a year's roadtax RM10,000, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because with 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, which is probably the editor's myvi to 30km/h when people reach 100km/h, well.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes that surround the body and the 6.5 V12 engine with an unobstructed view under the glass perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style.
You don't need to say too much about the description of the car, just Google yourself, the editor has sorted out some explanations that Google may not necessarily give!
It's so high-profile that everyone is watching everywhere you go, and it's very uncomfortable! (It's actually a bit cool)
1km fuel money is around RM1 (car owner does not care at all)
Practice the posture of getting on and off the car, otherwise it will be a little embarrassing (because you will not be able to climb out of the cabin and get stuck halfway)
The engine is too loud, and when you get out of the car, you will suddenly become deaf. (It's still cool, though)
The body is too large, parking in the ordinary parking space will be very narrow, very afraid of being knocked when the car next door opens the door!
It's a little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the editor himself said, it has nothing to do with the owner, haha)
Don't get me wrong, this video supercar is not for sale, sorry!
Friends who want to shoot videos for your car, welcome to contact us!

Involved in a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 I believe that car fans know that Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also million-class!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed off a million sports cars 911 and tens of millions of supercars Chiron in just a few minutes!
Looking at the result, it makes sense that expensive is expensive!
Let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times at the same frequency-Xinhuanet
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of school-running concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the process of development for a long time, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations, for China's universities, it arose in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit was deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times, advocating the value concept of "enlightening the world, repairing the peace and governing the peace" and the patriotic responsibility of "rejuvenating learning and strengthening the country".
At present, the trend of higher education informatization and internationalization is becoming increasingly obvious, the global competition in education, science and technology, and talent competition is intensifying, and the structural reform of higher education, as an important "supply side", is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and First-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China's confidence and determination to move forward from a big country in higher education to a strong country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become one of the world's top popular in a relatively short period of time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis that there is still a certain gap, so as to achieve "overtaking on a curve"?
In addition to firm confidence in goals, paths and abilities, colleges and universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the latecomer advantage, through the continuous introduction of outstanding overseas academic talents, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, to achieve a significant improvement in academic level and school quality; The second is cultural advantages, inheriting the wisdom connotation accumulated by Chinese civilization in 5,000 years, and promoting and developing excellent traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands and enhance image; The third is institutional advantages, giving full play to the institutional superiority of socialist countries, strengthening goal drive, pooling consensus and joint forces, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for schools to accelerate catching up with the world's advanced level.
In particular, it is necessary to realize that it is impossible to build a world-class university, and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while giving full play to its strengths.
The characteristics of running a school should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their unique target positioning, school-running traditions and resource endowments.
As far as Zhejiang University is concerned, we pay attention to highlighting the characteristics of three aspects in running schools: first, highlighting the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, building an integrated education environment that integrates science and education and school-enterprise integration, and forms a full-chain entrepreneurial education ecosystem; The second is to highlight the characteristics of interdisciplinary convergence, promote the optimization and adjustment of the discipline system, create an institutional environment for interdisciplinary disciplines, and actively cultivate interdisciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; The third is to highlight the characteristics of the school-running system and social services, carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate the formation of a pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligent Study, Moral Cultivation, Discernment, and Sincerity" and "Haina River, Qizhen and Virtue, Enlightening the People and Cultivating Our Country" constitute the latest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running the school, continuously accumulate cultural height and gather spiritual strength, with rich connotation and far-reaching significance.
Among them, "Haina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodies the mind of "the world's talents for my use", and is manifested in absorbing the high-quality concept of education of world-famous schools; "Enlightenment and Virtue" emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and perfection, which means that while pursuing the truth, universities should also receive the cultivation of virtue and the cultivation of personality; "Pioneering the people" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which not only includes the search for innovation in knowledge and the innovation of scientific research, but also manifests itself in reform and development, and revolutionizes the old and the new; "Tree My Country" emphasizes patriotic dedication and says that universities should always share the same glory and disgrace with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of schooling.
"The wise hear the silent, the wise see the formless".
Chinese colleges and universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the orientation of the times and the historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhere to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the university spirit stir with the spirit of the times and the national spirit, so as to provide inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation, and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

When NFT was quickly out of the loop, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity made a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a pet raising game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of gameplay including NFT, and is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume, with more than $3 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity earns more than $8.2 million a day, close to Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of "Axie Infinity" will pass a new "palytoearn" model to more people, through the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer a single character, in addition to getting fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecology.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game producer, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about a friend's stock price, my biggest feeling is the choice of the company on the track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry, first of all, we must choose the industry with large growth space, at least a market size of more than 100 billion; Secondly, we should choose industries with good future growth and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3-5 years; Finally, it is necessary to choose industries with policy support.
How wide the track is refers to the size of the market, how long the track is refers to the stage of development of the industry, and whether the track is flat or rugged refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize 2021 and adjust the 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which means do things right.
The strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is to find direction, tactics is to land, and on top of most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); For example, in addition to improving customer retention (tactical thinking), you can think about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); In addition to improving activity participation (tactical thinking), you can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving target customer engagement, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; On top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
12 years old, Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador designated bitcoin as legal tender, which is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved ProShares to launch a Bitcoin ETF for the first time in eight years and list it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF to land on the US capital market and expand cryptocurrency investment exposure again.
From the perspective of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduced the data burden on transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian American groups complain about admissions discrimination at Yale and other 3 Ivy League schools-Xinhuanet
Washington, May 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on 23 May to protest discrimination against Asian-American applicants at three Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth, in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of elite American schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three elite American schools has remained basically at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these colleges and universities "persistently and systematically discriminate against Asian-American applicants in their so-called "comprehensive" admissions process.
Zhao Yukong said that a 2014 study by Sanders and other scholars showed that in these three universities, Asians had the lowest acceptance rate of all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
U.S. Department of Education data also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest percentage of Asian students admitted to all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua that they expect that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these colleges and universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in admissions after determining the facts.
They also expect the complained colleges to take the initiative to take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies for Asians.
At present, the three universities complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 to complain about Harvard admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education rejected it on procedural grounds.
In addition to Chinese-American groups, the petition also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing agent about a factory located in Zhangting Town, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, and after several on-site inspections, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after consulting with Lin, a family member of the owner of the house, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory building and remitted 200,000 yuan by bank transfer as a deposit on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the "Receipt of Deposit for Factory Sale", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, this deposit belongs to the seller, if the seller is not willing to sell this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller twice, and the two parties agree to sign the factory sale contract within one week." ”
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of sale of the factory and the payment method, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for the sale of the house.
Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
The house that was hard to fancy, the deposit was paid, and the house payment was ready, so he signed the contract "at the door", but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu sued Lin to the Yuyao Municipal People's Court.
After hearing, the court held that the failure of the parties to sign a formal contract in the end could not only be attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed, so the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability for breach of contract of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
【Lawyer's Reminder】 In the transaction process, the necessary duty of care should be exercised.
When signing a contract, as a buyer, you must exercise the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
Chinese After the "democracy summit" on Friday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "leaders' democracy summit" to "draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, and act anti-democracy in the name of democracy, incite separatism and confrontation, and divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on others, promoted 'democratic transformation,' indiscriminately imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions,' resulting in disastrous consequences."
'Democracy' has long become a 'weapon of mass destruction' for the United States to interfere in other countries.
The summit is Biden's move to fulfill his campaign promise.
The two-day meeting, which was conducted virtually and was attended by leaders of 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but not by China and Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit.
There are also skeptical voices in the world and in the United States, such as criticizing the invited leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspecting that the Biden administration's real intention is not to organize the summit for democracy but for geopolitical purposes.
The newly appointed German Chancellor Scholz also participated in the Video Democracy Summit
China's Foreign Ministry statement on Saturday said that "today's American-style democracy is fully pathological, with problems such as money politics, identity politics, political party antagonism, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and the gap between the rich and the poor."
In his speech, U.S. President Joe Biden said, "As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent and accountable governance, and be more resilient to the buffers and shocks of authoritarian power, and those who want to nakedly pursue power before the public good." "
He stressed that democracy is not something that is taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it in each generation, and in my opinion it is the defining challenge of our time." "
Biden also said that democracy and human rights around the world "need fighters to defend it in the face of ongoing and worrying challenges."
The United States pledged a year-long campaign following the democracy summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democracies ahead of the Entity Democracy Summit planned for the end of 2022.
"Let's all live up to our commitments and report on our progress next year," Biden said.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address

Educational Thinking: How to Let "Top Students" and "Student Scum" Get Their Own Places in College Examinations - Xinhuanet
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote to the school leaders to reflect their confusion about the university exam, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the exam and change the question type so that the exam truly reflects the students' actual level.
Indeed, college exams have long been a "hot topic".
On university campuses, students come from all over the world, with different levels of ability, plus different levels of learning, and learning situations vary widely.
It is inevitable that there will be different feelings when assessing groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam question type is single, the repetition rate is high, and the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who do not need to work may be able to pass by concentrated assault before the exam, and if they think of other methods, they may achieve twice the effect with half the effort.
In this way, there are "scumbags" who can pass the test without investment, and even get high scores; "Xueba" usually never misses class, homework and notes are good, and the exam is not much higher than the "strange status quo".
In this way, it is not for nothing that Lanzhou Jiaotong University students report problems in university examinations, and I believe that this situation is not unique to Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, I would like to give a thumbs up to these three students who wrote straight to the letter.
In fact, people who have been to college know that it is not uncommon to prepare for the exam unexpectedly, think of various ways to "set" the exam questions from the teacher, strive to draw the scope of the exam, and seek "key guidance" before the exam, and even the situation of carrying a small copy in the exam and asking the teacher to raise his noble hand after the exam is not unusual.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, the measurement of whether a university exam passes or not, lies more in the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, and the scientific proposition on this basis.
Entering the undergraduate level, majors begin to be subdivided, and many professional courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether or not to fully grasp the basic knowledge points of a subject is the content to be tested in the university exam.
The undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline, and from the point of view of knowledge, the room for change is not large, and it is basically fixed.
As a teacher said, "The basic knowledge of university mathematics learned 20 years ago, and I am still learning it, which is still the focus." ”
However, the knowledge points are basically unchanged, which does not mean that the test question type is single and the test questions are repeated.
In many universities, the examination is generally formed into a question group, and then the senior teachers of the subject coordinate the composition of the examination paper, and the examination paper is also participated by all the teachers who undertake the subject, so that the situation of repeated test questions can be overcome to a certain extent.
However, it is necessary to formulate a set of test questions that conform to the reality of teaching and learning, and the questions are normally distributed according to the overall situation of students' learning, and it is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the exam propositions have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and question type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time carry out innovative design of the question type.
Examinations are the baton of university education, and what kind of exams there are, students will have corresponding preparation plans, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long run.
For the students' suggestion letter, Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to it, and has deployed a rectification plan throughout the university.
All teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and self-examination of end-of-course examinations, formulate examination paper propositions and related systems, and at the same time strengthen the supervision and inspection of examination paper propositions and review links, refine grade evaluation, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of curriculum teaching.
Solving the problems of single type of test questions and repeated questions from the mechanism is a topic that university examination affairs need to face, of course, it is necessary to introduce a corresponding system, but the effort is expensive in daily life, requiring teachers to fully grasp the teaching situation, not only to understand the teaching content, but also to understand the students' learning situation, both ends thoroughly, teaching and learning will be better docked, forming a benign interaction, the exam will also be more realistic, so that the "top students" and "scumbags" have their own place.

Mrs. Kim Wedding Photography (South Street) There is no branch yet
Before taking the photo, because we didn't arrange the time, we changed the time twice, and the consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.

The photographer is also very humorous and has a lot of fun taking pictures at the end of the day.
When choosing photos, because I saw many cases on the Internet, I was reluctant to let guests delete too many photos, but when we chose photos, really, there was no meaning for us to add photos, and none of the 24 photos in the direct package were added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos at about the same time as me, and added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000, I was stunned at that time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too much)
Today's photos were repaired, Lanlan sent it to me, I looked at two and thought it was not very good, and they immediately helped me repair it.
Comparing the photos taken by my sister before, I think our photos are really satisfied, simple and fresh, just the style I want.

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth paper Due to special security paper, it is out of stock
(Kota Kinabalu 11) The Sabah National Registration Bureau said that because the stock of special security paper has run out, it has not been able to issue birth papers to newborn babies since the beginning of October, and the cumulative number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the director, Kerouaminus, assured that all babies who have applied for birth papers are already recorded in the system and will be reissued when the security papers arrive next week.
At the press conference, he explained an online media report that the printing problem of Sabah's newspaper paper had been going on for 10 months.
He said the problem arose two months ago and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers of special security paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in arriving in China. ”
He explained that Sabah newspaper paper uses different security paper than other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' stocks.
Kairu Aminus revealed that the latest batch of security paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month, and then handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods, return to Sabah for the final stage of printing, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant in 2 working days (December 20). ”
"We will inform applicants to go to the local branch to collect the birth paper. ”
He added that Sabah has distributed 24,801 newsagents so far this year.

48-hour nucleic acid negative, set up a "buffer zone" The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council issued a document calling for strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic in port cities-Xinhuanet
Beijing, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- The joint prevention and control mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in port cities, requiring that personnel who have recently left land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and personnel going to land border port cities must take at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region and municipality determines the scope of the port city and announces it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that port cities with conditions can study setting up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdictions.
The relevant person in charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and border people from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of differentiated management policies by district, from one line of defense for prevention and control of spillovers to two lines of defense, is expected to move forward the threshold, reduce the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with minimal social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local cluster epidemics in China, all of which are imported from overseas epidemics through port cities.
The above notice pointed out that this exposed problems such as untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some places, non-implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing in form, inadequate sanitize of all links of cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and insufficient scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic.
The circular requires that efforts be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, accelerate the completion of the shortcomings of port cities, do a good job in prevention and control without relaxing, scientifically and accurately, and weave a tight external defense line against importation.
The notice emphasizes that all port cities should synchronize research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control and people's livelihood security work, publish and unblock the people's livelihood security hotline, regularly check the supply and price of basic living materials, and promptly solve and actively respond to prominent problems reported by the masses.
According to the circular, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, prefectures, leagues) where the open land, waterways and air ports are located, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region or municipality directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

YouTube video bottoms up the truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing of the US military - Xinhuanet
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States launching the Afghan war in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exporting American-style democracy through the war, and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Excessive use of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian places, distorting human nature and setting up killing groups.
Over the past 20 years, U.S. forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black jails" to inflict all kinds of torture and physical humiliation on "suspects."
Crime after crime against humanity has provoked more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the American-style "anti-terror" war is "more and more fearful."
The war has not brought the Afghan people hope for peace, democracy and prosperity, but only a devastated country and countless killings and destruction.
Poke the video, let's debunk the truth of the bloodthirsty killing of the United States in the name of "anti-terrorism", and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
I accidentally saw the next article, from a commercial perspective and shelf life point of view to talk about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded zone to help make canning, although the canning belongs to deep processing, not the business scope of the bonded logistics company, here the following text may explain Why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and came into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and listening are exactly the same, and there is no difference.
Then everyone will definitely ask: why is the shelf life of bags one year, while the shelf life of listening packages is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and bagging so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
Some consumers reacted after eating out of this mentality, and said that the taste or taste of the pretending is different!
Now let me tell you about the reason why it is expensive, where is it expensive?
Why is the price difference so large when they have the same raw materials?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the bag price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or there is no profit, so what does the manufacturer rely on to survive?
So they have a big increase in the pricing of listening equipment to protect their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers mainly recommend listening packaging, not bags.
And you think that so many manufacturers have tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising every year, where does this cost come from?
As you can imagine.
Then with the development of society, the promotion costs of the market, such as: the promotion personnel of the mall, the display cost of the shopping mall, the cost of product gifts, advertising costs, etc. are also increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products, and it is a listening device, and its price is also constantly rising, in fact, this is a new product with the increase of market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, the cost of their raw materials will not exceed 3 or 4 yuan at most.
There are also some brands, in order to promote their own products, unscrupulously, linked with hospital doctors, who assist in the promotion of products, from a profit ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan.
China's laws absolutely do not allow such operating methods, in fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder into the tank under the premise of having a can at home, which can save costs, and increase the preservation and sealing of milk powder, and there is no impact on children.
And don't think that the shelf life of the listening package is longer than the bag, if the shelf life of the listening package and the bag is the same after opening the bag, just that the bag is not easy to store after opening, easy to get wet and deteriorate.

Don't intimidate people at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When visiting the book market, you can often feel the popularity of success books.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle"—that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you "what" you need to do.
It is equivalent to suddenly crossing the most important and fundamental link of "how to do it".
Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either do the best at all or do nothing; Either 100 or 0; Either you climb Mount Tarzan, or you simply stay where you are.
This "best principle" is "incomparably correct" for anyone who looks at it, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, be a new person, and make a 180-degree transformation", which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For people who conform to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you want to shout "you want to change" in his ear, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano to the cow.
The vast majority of people will show their timidity in front of the word "transformation", hold back, and find it difficult to make up their minds; Or with a momentary impulse, they make a determination to "transform" and bravely take the first step, but often the good times do not last long, and they cannot hold out for a while before they are defeated, and it is difficult to see sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous crosstalk of "Starting from Tomorrow" is the most expressive expression of this "universal humanity" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities and makes the vast majority of people "look at the door and sigh".
Perhaps, the "sub-best principle" is a path that has the potential to put more ordinary people on the path to relative success.
The core of the "suboptimal principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a "small victory for a big victory" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; If you can't climb Mount Tai, you can just climb the small sand dunes in front of your house, because that's better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is better than not doing it.
Since the threshold is greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to persist, and as long as everything persists, the probability of success will increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "sub-best principle" is slightly longer.
All in all, the "best principle", despite its ostensible banner of making everyone successful, is actually a minority; The "sub-optimal principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

The resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake increased by 0.71 million tons this year-Xinhuanet
Xining, 11 Dec (Xinhua) -- This reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake this year increased by 7,100 tons over the previous year to 108,500 tons, a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with the initial period of protection in 2002.
Qinghai Lake nudibranch, commonly known as "Huangyu", is a unique and precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a decisive role in maintaining the security and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, due to factors such as large-scale human hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment of naked carp breeding waters, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply, and the resource reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake nudibranchs were listed as endangered in the Red List of Chinese Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has closed the lake for fish breeding, prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from fishing for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and the lake area, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, cleaning up the main rivers and rivers in Qinghai Lake, and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the reserves of nudibranchs in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, nearly 180 million naked carps in Qinghai Lake have been artificially multiplied and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of nudibranchs resources in Qinghai Lake.
The source area of the three rivers in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the source area of the Three Rivers and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since the beginning of this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices prohibiting fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of "one river, one river and one lake".

Just saw an article about menstruation, it's too long.
Give science popularization to men who don't know.
Most girls suddenly experience their first menstrual period someday between the ages of 13 and 15, with amenorrhea around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, I will come once a month more regularly.
But it is not regular enough to accurately predict, about a week or so of tolerance, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will also overturn (suddenly several days in advance).
The length of time, blood volume, and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person, some for three days, some for one week; Some people shed little, some people bleed; Some people don't react, some people are so painful that the ambulance is taken away, dysmenorrhea will change over time, and no pain before does not mean no pain for a lifetime.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding for 24 hours from the beginning to the end of the day, and all that can be done is to use a sanitary napkin or tampon to suck blood to prevent it from flowing to clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins, and eating ibuprofen quickly at the beginning of the menstrual period can effectively relieve the pain of the month, and it is useless to eat after the start of dysmenorrhea.
Before the menstrual period, due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins, it is easy to have diarrhea.
If it is about the cycle, inexplicable diarrhea, basically menstruation will occur within two days.
Sanitary napkins are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria, remove sleep time, the worst case is to replace 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is, 42 tablets, if you add the portion prepared in advance may have 50 tablets, not one tablet per month.
(Modify it here, tampons do not have to be changed often, about five or six hours can be changed, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may be more irritable, and ovulation will also be emotionally unstable due to hormonal changes in the body, which is very unlucky, and the body makes a trip to itself.
But official crime data shows that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and they do not make excuses for emotional problems.
It's not just blood that flows, it contains the shed endometrium.
After the end of menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then slowly thickens, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, every month to build a house (the lining thickens) to prepare to welcome guests, guests do not come, all demolished (menstrual discharge) next month and build a new house, and so on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient, for decades, 24 hours a day a month bleeding, there will be abdominal pain and low back pain, who wants?
But people can be born because his mother has menstruated, menstruation is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first come to this world, and everyone should thank your mother for regular and healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things for women were suppressed, and society brainwashed women as dirty and shameful, and everyone thought it was like that, but times have changed.
If someone feels disgusting menstruation, feels that the preparation behavior of the female body for giving birth to life is disgusting, should not be said in public, girls stand up, don't think so, have never experienced it, will not experience it in this life, and men who don't know much about it, don't be so ungrateful, how can this attitude be embarrassed to face their mother, how can they be embarrassed to want their own children?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Today is the winter solstice festival, and it is disappointing to send it wrong
Order meals for children
I hope that the store will check the products in their busy schedule
Is the foot bath numb foot leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good role in foot therapy, today Gome Xiaobian will answer this question, I hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's awareness of health care, foot baths are more and more loved by consumers, and a large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan of foot baths, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are hot, but there is no special industry standard for foot baths, so there are certain safety risks.
"Soaking your feet in charged water is too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt numb on the soles of his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought that it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he did not expect that when the vibration function was turned off, his father still felt numb in the soles of his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with an electric pen, and the electric pen actually lit up, and Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was actually electrified.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the attitude of the merchant was good, and although the foot bath was returned, Mr. Li was still unhappy.
Because he found that this long-popular foot bath now does not have a clear and detailed industry regulation in terms of setting the maximum temperature, which people it is suitable for, and what kind of material is guaranteed to be harmless.
However, under normal circumstances, the foot bath will not have the problem of electricity, but it is not excluded that a few products are not strictly controlled when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a split foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, without any safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take an electric pen to measure it casually.
Opening of the 13th Provincial Tea Expo - View Headlines - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All-media reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photography Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Promotion Conference was held in Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, displaying the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.
Hou Shunli, Deputy Director of the Council of All-China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Ye Hongzhuan, Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, grandly introduced at the opening ceremony: the source of lake red is new, and the rise of black tea injects new impetus into "colorful Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the 100 billion Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "three Xiang, four water and five colored teas".
The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, green tea, black tea, black tea and other main teas have taken turns, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving the majority of tea farmers to increase income.
Feng shui takes turns, and black tea is powerful again.
Experts in the tea industry in the province said that after picking green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens has risen sharply.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark "Hunan Black Tea", and Xinhua praised the "source of lake red".
In the Xinhua Black Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants took a fancy to a high-mountain tea called "Binglichun" and immediately placed an order.
Wang Zhun, secretary general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have more or less affected the tea market, but from the scene of the tea expo, there are many highlights.
Xinhua black tea is a touch of red, infused with tea culture connotation, popularity, trading fire, Xiang tea industry welcomes the new spring.
So if these foods are not hot, can they be canceled?
I didn't want it, and since there was no way to park below, he couldn't deliver it
Metaphysics refers to the study of questions through rational reasoning and logic that cannot be answered directly through perception.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy that aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
Chinese translation of the name "metaphysics" is taken from the phrase "the metaphysical is the way, and the metaphysical is the instrument" in the I Ching • Zhizhi Upload, which is translated from metaphysic by the Japanese Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era).
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and its extended questions.
Ontology is "the study of which nouns represent real entities of existence and which nouns represent only a concept."
Metaphysical naturalism refers to the denial of the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is the notion that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, and was proposed by philosophers who supported science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to the study of God without saying a word.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of consciousness and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the "relationship between mind and body".
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and research on human moral life; Here, morality is defined as all codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into metaethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (evaluating different moral views and suggesting moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior).
It studies what forms of moral conduct people should follow), applied ethics (scholarship that applies ethical theories to real life situations, including bioethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing them from observed patterns).
Its examination of ethics does not proceed from the theory of preconception, but investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors that contribute to this decision, and it examines the ethical views held by the social community).
The history of ethics includes Greco-Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.

Ding Zilin: To friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for the humanitarian assistance you have given during the more than 30 years since the death of our loved ones, especially since I personally appealed for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in early 1994.
Today, most of the victims' old parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up and started families.
It is your acts of righteousness that have helped our families in distress through the most difficult times.
The pandemic is raging around the world, and most of our donors are retiring.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to suspend the humanitarian donation to our bereaved Tiananmen Mothers Group, which is long overdue.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way, please understand my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Tao Ye Press: Allow me to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the 32-year history of IFCSS and the China Democracy Foundation (MCDF) in Minnesota.
In the process of humanitarian relief, the All-American Self-Federation and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project implementers often overlap.

Relief money often did not reach the June Fourth victims.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Teacher Ding, a special group was set up by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF set up the June Fourth Orphan Education Fund, and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June Fourth orphans graduated from university, MCDF then established the June Fourth Orphaned Elderly Special Hardship Household Relief Fund, which has been implemented ever since.
Funding for these projects came primarily from campus and social donations in June Fourth, from generous donations from individuals, and with support from the Brother University Foundation for Democracy.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Laogai Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, after 31 years, that the families finally received a partial donation from Hong Kong that year in the name of June Fourth.
During this period, Chinese Right was also independently implementing their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Mr. Ding's call to stop the June Fourth donation is for the consideration of donors, and we are indeed some retired elderly people, whose income is not as abundant as before retirement, and we would like to thank Mr. Ding for his "letter to friends".
We will respect the decision of the families to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if needed.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those fellow believers who have insisted on generously donating and risking humanitarian relief for many years.

Thank you rabbit for your comment Originally said that rejecting the ancient style is not suitable for the ancient style I didn't expect the finished product to come out and it was simply beautiful
Thank you Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of batteries and continue to move forward, we will continue to cheer!
This photography studio is really fantastic Highly recommend to all the little friends!
Impeccable from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match the makeup that suits you according to your style, and the cosmetics are all first-line big brands.
Not to mention Mr. Tian Liang, photography is quite professional.
The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two kittens to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to queue up half a year in advance, and my colleagues have filmed in Beijing, and I feel just so so after watching the finished film.
I deliberately searched for this studio, a place with a soul and an attitude.
Our facial expression management is relatively poor, and I think this is also a short version for most people, and photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-designer, a fine team.
We and the people around us were full of praise.
I have recommended my girlfriend to go over, and my girlfriend is just as happy after watching the negative.
I hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover TA and shoot their own style, rather than the same.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews of Zhan Ying and Jing Ling, both of them are very thoughtful and creative newcomers, we are the creative studio, as long as the customers like us do our best to complete it, grateful for the acquaintance and encounter
Sweet and caring assistant, as well as lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice and wonderful shooting, a very unforgettable experience, and the shooting effect is much better than I imagined Everyone worked hard, thank you 😘😘 very much
Thank you Xiaoyu for your comment Knowing you is also a fate From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, trust in us is thousands of kilometers away I am very happy to meet you and have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao next time

A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you plan to enter the industry in this industry, you can choose to find a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself, after all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you plan to enter the pit in this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-control, you can also choose to learn by yourself, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we must look at the teachers of this institution, if the teachers are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing, inquire about this training institution, it is best to inquire about the students from this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how this institution is, and whether the courses explained are good or not.
Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question, because there is no certain introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even in which city, these will be related to the industry you study or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or the computer major has graduated, then if there is enough time I personally recommend self-study, this is the lowest efficiency and cost, now many offline and online training institutions are actually very good, but one learning cost is high, the second investment time is more, basically need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it is the situation I said, self-study is very convenient, now many learning resources on the Internet are free, or go to station B also have a lot of training resources, if you will not find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction, get free resources, or detailed consultation can also do.
In addition, there are some more classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to study, so that learning does not have to be very difficult, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and people specifically answer, and it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal quotas, and it is recommended to go to the company after learning, so that the interview process of finding a job can also save a lot of things.
The above is some of my views, the aforementioned because I don't understand your situation, so only a general introduction is not detailed, if you have other want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I would arrive before 1 o'clock, and I saw it in the app

The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; If you rise to the challenge, the problem will be solved.
Curators from China and Saudi Arabia jointly held the first Saudi Biennale of Contemporary Art - Xinhuanet
Riyadh, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale, the Diliya Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the Diliya JAX Art District, located in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participating.
The Biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriya Biennale Foundation and UCCA Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in China, with Feiyu Tian, Director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, China, as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi Arabia's social and cultural development.
Covering an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, the exhibition halls span six interconnected buildings and are presented in six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going to the Public", "Brave New World" and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performing arts. The work of 12 Chinese artists is also in the spotlight, some using recycled materials in novel ways, such as Xu Bing's reconstruction of a classic landscape painting from waste in The Endless Picture of the Creek Mountain in the Story Behind the Series (2014).
Bakli, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, expressed the hope that this biennale will establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia's thriving cultural industry and creative community, and strengthen interaction.
"The goal of the Biennale is twofold, both to engage Saudi contemporary art in the global dialogue and to engage Saudi audiences in the contemporary art world," said Philip Tinnacle. ”
It is understood that during the opening week of the biennale, there will also be a series of lectures where artists, curators and opinion leaders from the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhuanet
Kunming, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- In order to continue to do a good job in providing employment assistance for people who have been lifted out of poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements in poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote rural revitalization and rural public welfare post management to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare jobs for the employment of rural difficult groups such as poverty alleviation labor, and plays an important role in helping the people who have been lifted out of poverty to increase employment and income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
The new regulations were jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization and Finance, and mainly standardized the scope of targets, fund management, post development, and post management of personnel recruited for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulations are clear that the setting is carried out in accordance with the principles of "setting up posts according to needs, appointing people by post, dynamic management, and total volume control", "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training and job placement.
In addition, the new regulations also clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods for rural public welfare posts, and stipulate that each rural public welfare post development department shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare post placement personnel; Relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the distribution of subsidies for rural public welfare posts.
The address is wrong
Hello
Whether the order can be canceled
I place a new order
Whether it has been canceled
Second, although the rightists have an era of ambition in history, they are not long, so they are short because they give a little sunshine and sweat; A little Zhizhi will get Longwang Shu, and if he is hit, he will be attached.
But realistically speaking, the right has played an active role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of ending the Cultural Revolution and defining the criterion of truth, developing the economy and improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
Third, as far as I am concerned, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is also serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, I think that against the necessary revolution, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, mixed political groups, and foreign countries.
Fourth, to change or improve China's attitude of patience and responsibility for the country and the people, those who try to take advantage of political speculation are not rightists, they are bastards.
Let's talk about the left.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, and the Communist Party will listen to some right's speech and analyze their ideas when needed, then the left will not be created, because what the left wants is exactly the dregs that the Communist Party throws away!
Fifth, I recently saw some friends refuting the left madness while scaring against thieves, and they were still very angry, I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with the traitors and the left madness, they are all tendons, and there is nothing to talk about.
Don't try to prove that we're right, and don't think about getting anti-thieves and leftists to admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends like this: When the anti-thief scolds you Wumao, when the left madness scolds you and the right dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people also have ideals when they are young, but when they are old, they forget their ideals, or pursue them, but they become paranoid.
Drifting away from ideals, even the dragon slayer boy eventually became a dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to restraint and freedom, and China's innate genes from history and culture have led to the fact that China as a whole should be left.
While the right in the country is liberal and focuses on efficiency and development, the left is more concerned about fairness and security.
Now the society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, and at the same time China and the United States are contending, the leftist is certain, and it is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, like it and it's over
Don't say anything, Hua Hua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and containment of Huawei chips by US imperialism has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented predicament, but also caused "American" enterprises to suffer huge losses.
The US imperialist suppressed China's chip industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises in allied countries to blockade China's chip industry at the same time, which directly led to the impact on the orders and profits of global chip suppliers, resulting in a decrease in R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing a shortage of chip supply chains around the world.
Now the "lack of cores" has affected major industries around the world, such as car companies stopping production, mobile phone prices rising, almost all industries that use chips are deeply affected.
In order to master the autonomy of "chips", more and more countries' technology giants have begun to move towards the road of "de-beautification".
In order to firmly control the global semiconductor control and contain the development of China's semiconductor industry, the old United States has recently made frequent moves and presided over the "chip summit"; For example, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip field, the old technology giant Intel spent $20 billion to build 2 wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened the chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel's move will have a certain impact on TSMC, and it is likely to take away TSMC's "rice bowl".
The reason why it is so certain is that Intel, as an old technology giant of the US imperialism, has been deeply engaged in the semiconductor field for decades, has a large number of talent teams and technical reserves, and will surely be able to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, for Intel's decision, TSMC founder Zhang Zhongmou was dismissive.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou said amazingly, for Intel's move to invest in the construction of fabs, Zhang Zhongmou said bluntly: Intel builds a chip foundry, which is quite ironic.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel's entry into the wafer field is because Zhang Zhongmou is still worried about a grudge between Frontend Semiconductor and Intel for more than 30 years.
In the sixties and seventies of last century, Intel has always been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the US imperialism, occupying the top position in the world, and is the hegemon in the world's semiconductor field.
By the 80s of last century, the world's semiconductor high-end chips have been mastered by a few strong people.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, and the chip from design, manufacturing to packaging and testing was completed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this model overwhelms some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs can only be deterred by huge production line construction costs.
In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, and he thought that since there was a special design, then a factory dedicated to wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou's idea became a reality, and TSMC came into being.
TSMC aims its main business at the single link of "wafer processing", does not design, and only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, TSMC, which had just been founded, was a small minions in front of Intel, a giant.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once asked Intel to invest, but at that time, when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obviously a little self-esteemed, looked down on TSMC, and decisively refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also determined that Intel looked down on wafer process services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giants who looked down on wafer manufacturing services back then are now starting to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou feels that Intel's entry into wafer foundry is ironic.
Today, TSMC's market capitalization has surpassed Intel's.
In the face of TSMC's strong attack, Intel naturally does not dare to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC has sprinted towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm 7 years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
Don't wait

Let's take a look at some [strange hot searches] today.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February Erlong raised its head, Holliyou price increase, cargo pull incident, public opinion diffusion to form a crest, and then [index decline] (smooth curve) finally dissipated, if secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small hump reappearing.
They look similar to the [Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Six hot searches in the same event were randomly selected, showing [Lone Peak], [Jagged], and [Cliff-like].
[Lone peak] is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the hot search, attracting public attention; [Jagged] that is, periodic heating to ensure that the topic is entrenched in the hot search list; [Cliff-like] that is, collective evacuation, the hot search has completed its "function", received a new task, and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat peak of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is not bad, and it must be a unified batch of water troops receiving the task and starting a new round of offensive.
The specialization of black public relations can be seen: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for popular science, which lead the war to create momentum, which divert attention, which affect cognition, which mislead judgment, which incite emotions, which envelop decisions, black production accounts are refined in batches and nodes, taking into account almost all the elements of public opinion spread and diffusion.
Communication is a science, aside from all subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, black public relations will also be nowhere to hide.
Whoever walks through will leave traces, and we will dig up such traces together.

The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed the first three cases of Omicron virus infection.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not hospitalized because they all had mild cases.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Cypriot government has continuously increased prevention and control efforts.

I #NAME# CALLED YOUR STAFF TO EXPLAIN
Your riders told me the address was too far away
Damei 360 integrated home decoration
Address: 12th floor, Happy Home, No. 156, South Huancheng Road
At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to take a look, and at first my budget was 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
Came to the store and began a series of scams.
I came to the store for the first time just showed them my floor plan, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they could actually give me a quotation that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, roughly showed me their materials and did not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second trick is that you will drag you to pay the deposit whenever you arrive at the store (and once this money is paid, you will never be able to return it, unless you have enough experience to fight with them).
When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you how much discount we can give you today as long as you pay the deposit.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being deceived, and when my mind is impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000.
The quote he gave me had a lot of problems, 70,000 did not include the water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets bathrooms, and these three are the cost of base installation.
In addition to these, their service point fees are also higher than other companies.
I lost trust in the company and asked me to sign the contract without making anything clear at first.
When I go to them to return the money, they show a very experienced appearance and have a dedicated small team to deal with you.
In any case, it will be a bite to death, it is the customer's problem, and they are completely not responsible.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, there are many details, I don't want to say them one by one are tears, in short, don't choose them, because my friend looking for them to renovate the house is also of poor quality, and I will calculate various expenses for you in the later stage.
Pit daddy, they are the original deceptive dragon head decoration, now changed to Da Mei, it seems that it has been closed down and changed to something else.
So don't choose such a pit daddy decoration company.
In the future, when you choose, take a look at these more Baidu and check these consultations, because decoration is not small money.
To ask a business a question, sign in or sign up

So terrifying, if you don't have more than 30 minutes, please cancel your order!
Is there no other way? For example, change the address?
Okay, then don't cancel this conversation, if you don't refund me in 5 to 10 days, you will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it was possible to cancel in less than 15 minutes

The starry sky has about 丨 Geminid meteor shower ushered in a great - Xinhuanet on the 14th
Tianjin, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Astronomical science experts introduced that as the last large-scale meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will usher in a great deal on December 14, and friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night after that day.
Beijing astronomer Anjiu photographs the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers have their parent bodies as periodic comets, but the Geminids are home to asteroid 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo-type asteroid.
The Geminids are also the second known meteor shower that was not "conceived" by a comet.
Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomical science, said that just like the New Year blockbuster, the Geminid meteor shower generally appears at the end of the year, and the "release schedule" can last from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere along with the Quadrant meteor shower and the Perseid meteor shower.
A notable feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that meteoroids are slower, colorful, and have many bolides, which are suitable for both visual and astrophotography beginners.
Tianjin astronomy enthusiast Yang Jing photographed the Geminid meteor shower in Tianjin's Jixian on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will reach a maximum at about 15:00 on December 14, with a maximum of 150 ZHR (the number of meteors that can be seen per hour when the radiant is directly above the head under ideal observation conditions).
Geminid meteor shower recommended index chart.
"Last year, the 'colorful falling' Geminid meteor shower made a big impression, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be disturbed by moonlight, and the excitement will be a little reduced.
The 14th is the eleventh day of the 11th lunar month, the moon phase is a convex moon, bright moonlight will interfere with observation, fortunately in the second half of the night the moon will set, at this time the radiant of the Geminids meteor shower will also rise higher.
Friends who like meteor showers can observe in the middle of the night when the moon is behind, but pay attention to cold and warmth. ”
How can you observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with a high altitude, low light damage, and a wide view facing the northeast in the suburbs or countryside, and then patiently wait until the moon sets and observe visually."
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flow in all directions, and there is no need to keep staring at the radiant of the Geminid meteor shower when observing.
If you want to shoot a gorgeous 'meteor shower blockbuster', it is best to choose a wide-angle, large-aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
For stability and durability, a tripod, battery backup and shutter cable are also essential. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the subject should refer to the LCD TV, and the difference between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning mainly has the following two points:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large-screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large-screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TVs is mostly 55 inches to 65 inches, while the size of laser TVs is generally more than 75 inches, and the largest is more than 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large-screen color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales proportion of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Zhongyikang's forecast, in 2020, the sales growth of the laser TV market will exceed 140%, continuing to maintain rapid growth.
The reason why it has such good results in the large-screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball, compared with the backlight of the LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
Ophthalmologists from Saixi Laboratory of China Electronics Standardization Institute and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparative tests of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions of the population.
The data confirms that laser TV does have strong eye-protection characteristics, and even has a certain improvement effect in specific aspects.
At a time when vision health is getting more and more attention, laser TV not only attracts more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the continuous decline in LCD TV prices, the current price of commercially available laser TVs is mostly more than 10,000 yuan, and with the upgrade of size and light source, the price has gradually risen.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
It certainly makes sense.
Under the continuous development of light sources and technical levels, laser TVs have many advantages that LCD TVs and projection cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and it can achieve a 100-inch large-screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the host is small and occupies a small space.
In terms of brightness, big brand laser TVs can reach more than 2000 lumens.
In addition, the heat generation is lower, the loss of equipment is small, and the service life of the TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are also equipped with many cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra-high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and bionic screens, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
Not to talk about pseudo-demand, but the product of demand segmentation, on the picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not the dish of audio and video players, want to take into account the large screen and viewing environment is insufficient, you can try, everything has advantages and disadvantages, weigh up and judge yourself, I am afraid to listen to one side of the word.
Simply put, ultra-wide-angle close-focus projectors - laser TVs, in order to stay close to the curtain, have to use expensive ultra-wide-angle lenses and mirrors, which do not meet the optimal optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, the use of micro-structure Fresnel curtain is expensive, and the price of 80 inches can basically be replaced with a 65-inch LCD.
Another point, I especially hate the projection manufacturers to use diffuse reflection for the eyes as a selling point, please, the light on the curtain that the eyes can see is direct light for the eyes, you diffuse to the ceiling, the eyes can't see, have to be more real LCD TV is also diffuse "direct", open the TV ceiling is not also illuminated?
Moreover, if the projection screen is not diffuse, it will not be like an image at all.
It is precisely the hot spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain curtain that is ignored, and a large amount of light is reflected to the eye at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

Added the WeChat appointment date, the young lady sent me the optional time arrangement, and the reply message was more timely~
Before I went, I saw the shooting works in the store, more outdoor wedding dresses, the shooting was very beautiful, and there were many shooting styles involved.
After the day arrived, I briefly exchanged my thoughts with my young lady, and very patiently helped me try two sets of clothes that I was entangled in, and finally finalized the start of makeup styling~ The photographer will put some props before shooting, will guide the action, and strive for excellence in every detail.
But maybe because I didn't communicate specific shooting ideas with me, the shooting was not the style I wanted, but it should be good-looking 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select the photos and exchange the post-production style, which feels very careful.
The repaired piece takes about half a month, sit and wait for the effect~
The second time I won the photo overlord meal activity~ Most of the clothes in the audience can choose one piece to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black gauze dress to experience different styles.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of the 95s, I feel a little young, I hope that customers can give more suggestions in the future in terms of shooting action guidance ~ quite talkative, the shooting process is more pleasant.

On the home page, let's take a look at Queenie~
When I arrived at the store, I first filled in the name phone number and then chose the clothing, the wedding dress can be chosen, and I changed three or four sets of clothing quite patiently, after choosing a long time of makeup, the service attitude is also good, the shooting will teach you how to pose, that is, the feeling of the face is so big, the refinement said that it will take half a month, and it will be sent in three or four days, and it feels like there is no difference from the original film
【Environment】Overall fine.
Plenty of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup positions, and inside is the studio.
【Service】Very warm and attentive.
The stylist is quite patient.
The photographer will also teach you the movement very seriously.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer will also take the initiative to reshoot.
【Experience】Maybe the styling is a little too much, and the original double eyelids were pasted with three eyelids.
The tail of the eyebrows is also shaved, which is a little embarrassing for not thrushing in daily life.
The photo has been given for more than ten days, but the effect of the P picture is not very satisfactory, and I feel that the double eyelid stickers are still obvious.
Because I didn't know what style I wanted, I tried two sets, and I picked and chosen, and I chose a black dress, and the little sister said that this set was more Hepburn retro
After choosing the clothes, I started to make up and hair, and the hairstylist and makeup artist sister were super patient and helped me get it, and the result was very satisfactory
Once I got my makeup and hair, I started taking pictures, and the photographer directed me to pose the whole time, and the process was very easy and harmonious
After filming, I carefully chose four favorite pictures when refined, and the little brother said that it was a film within 15 days, and the ending was very satisfactory~
No reply for 3 days... Since my credit card is not recognized by your system, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# Plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay
I now have to pay for shipping every time
Can you waive it first and charge my monthly fee until you investigate it?
Is it reliable to buy insurance for small umbrellas?
Little Umbrella is an internet-based insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: according to the "Provisions on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance brokerage company, three keywords must be met: shareholders and promoters have no major illegal records in the past 3 years, the minimum amount is RMB 50 million to be established, and the consent of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission must be obtained.
These three are actually very harsh, summed up is to have strength, to be approved by the national authority of the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders must have a good style, as an insurance brokerage company's small umbrella insurance, the policyholder does not need to question too much whether the small umbrella insurance is formal or not, after all, there are these 3 thresholds, not any insurance company can meet.
At this point, not bad and trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products: small umbrella insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies' star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the latest Hetai Super Marie No. 5 critical illness insurance, the claimant and insurer are Hetai Life, small umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, no need to question its reliability.
From the perspective of payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the lack of operating expenses of business outlets and the cost of business employees, so Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, support monthly payment, reduce the payment pressure of policyholders, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
Can be considered.
From the perspective of salesman professionalism: this point is particularly important, because insurance is a very professional requirements of the industry, many Internet product customers can apply for their own insurance, this will have a lot of misunderstandings, in the health notice and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often in the insurance will add their own subjective awareness, feel that they are healthy or in line, so easy to have a lot of claims hidden dangers, may be denied the risk of compensation.
I myself have done insurance telesales in "Tencent Microinsurance" (like Xiao Umbrella, which is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I tell everyone very responsibly.
Internet insurance is real and reliable, unreliable is people, Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
For example: 1 yuan insurance insurance 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 critical illness insurance, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but avoid the important and light, will not tell the policyholder, the first month of 1 yuan, the next month is required to charge according to the normal, tens to 200, many customers deduct a year or two to buy what they buy is not clear.
Thought that it could cost 1 yuan, and the insurance company would pay 6 million (pie in the world).
Free mobile phone delivery, is the policy tail number such as 6666, 8888 such as special policy number segment to send, and if the winning SMS is sent, they will not redeem, and no one will remind them.
(This is another pit for the insured) Free 60,000 critical illness insurance, is short-term, if only rely on this, there is no other commercial insurance, in case of serious illness, 60,000 can do, can not solve the problem, the future life begins to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
So on the whole, there is no problem with the platform, there is no problem with the product, and the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the subject consider comprehensively and carefully, in fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and the cost performance of some products is better than that of Internet products.
I have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, saving 2000-3000 yuan per person per year.
If you have any questions, welcome to communicate with me.
Me: Minya insurance broker, has 3 years of business management training experience, served nearly a thousand enterprise users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies, before applying for insurance, I will start from customer needs, tailor insurance products for customers, insured, shop around for customers, try to strive for the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, do policy sorting for customers, policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow for life with every customer.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authorities, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the policyholder can independently complete all the insurance application processes after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder independently.
Although the application of Internet insurance is not too "ceremonial", and there may not even be a printed version of the paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic version of the contract at all.
This model is somewhat similar to the assembly line operation of "telemarketing", but buying insurance in this way also has a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not be able to keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades, when we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is an "insurance intermediary" that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?

I have always opposed any form of slander and name-calling, let alone such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can be all-inclusive, but we must eliminate such villains.
If you do not look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized style that must be resisted first.
From the time you started sending Facebook and friend requests, then making mocking posts, to your attempts to post my home location and father's name on social media, I've taken a non-responsive attitude.
After that, you intensified not only to continue to tag me according to the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to brazenly discuss some cryptic and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as appearance, figure, good fertility, and what kind of strawberries are planted in bed, whether to insert messages such as this, I... Forget it.
Later, I received a number of messages from friends about your Facebook friend account uploading a photo of you and sexually harassing comments.
Sorry, as a girl, I can't continue to be silent.
After the news of my police was uploaded, you did not restrain at all, but became more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, no matter what your status is, in our society, there is a need for gender respect.
Yes, you can continue to make this ridiculous, subtle, humiliating, abusive remark, you can continue to say that you just care and care about me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it is not your picture or continue to make all offensive remarks.
That's right, I can't and can't stop you.
I don't know you, I don't want to know you, and I don't need you to judge my appearance and figure.
I don't even think there is a girl who would want to let others humiliate themselves so much in exchange for being famous.
My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said yes, and you won't believe it.
I don't think there will be a girl who can say that she is okay after being bullied like this.
Whether at work, in society, in politics or in business, only those who do not have even basic moral qualities would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in people's hearts.
I have cut off some of the comments for everyone to comment
There should be no one who can impersonate you in your own posts
I can only say that you are a public enemy of civilization
Smile heartily
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Zheng attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum

"Zhihui Xiaoxiang" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit Opens - Rolling News - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (All-media reporter Zhou Shuheng) On the 9th, the "Zhihui Xiaoxiang" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Zhuzhou.
Wang Cheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Director of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, attended the launching ceremony and delivered a speech.

Three U.S. aircraft carriers assemble around China, the most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam 2022-01-17 Multidimensional pro-CCP media multi-dimensional report: The latest news on Sino-US relations: the latest satellite images show that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; The US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal rarely visited Guam, sending an important signal to US allies and adversaries in the Indo-Pacific region.
On January 9, satellites spotted the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Barabac Strait, according to the South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank.
The Barabac Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific.
The platform expects the Carl Vinson to be deployed in the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has been deployed with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey carrier-based transport aircraft.
In addition to the Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is the U.S. aircraft carrier.
For the first time, the USS Lincoln also carried the F-35C carrier-based aircraft squadron, which is part of the U.S. Marine Corps' 314th Fighter Strike Squadron.
In addition to the two carriers, the U.S. Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region as the USS Ronald Reagan, which docks in Yokosuka, Japan.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser "Lake Champlain" and the guided-missile destroyer "Stockdal".
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.

(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situational Awareness) According to CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy's arsenal made a rare visit to Guam last weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, sailed into the U.S. naval base in Guam last Saturday (Jan. 15).
Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, the most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysis said that this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 80s of the 20th century.
Three US Aircraft Carriers Gather Around China, Most Powerful Weapons Visit Guam Rarely China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Fiery Cross Island in the Spratly Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada strengthens cooperation between the United States and allies in the region, demonstrating U.S. capabilities, flexibility, combat readiness and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. Navy said in a statement.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the 14 Thundering submarines in the U.S. Navy fleet are usually kept strictly secret.
The secrets surrounding ballistic missile submarines make the Thunder Submarine "the most important survival weapon of the nuclear triad," a system that also includes silo ballistic missiles located on the U.S. mainland, and nuclear-tipped bombers such as the B-2 and B-52.
Talking to friends about the recent 26% plunge in Meta, the market value lost $251 billion, Zuckerberg responded to "facing unprecedented competition", why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue mainly comes from advertising, and today's money-making advertising companies have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., no matter what kind of functional positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is also the largest "advertising network", and many apps that add to Meta's ads are monetized through Meta's advertising platform.
However, times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly, and it will obviously prompt users whether to allow the app to access their own information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
If Google stabs again, the impact on Meta's revenue will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has also weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it exists).
Everyone usually knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China each year, mainly from Chinese companies that do maritime business.
Meta has about a few hundred people in its office in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, Byte's TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the first two years Meta made a lot of money from Byte.
Various domestic agents are helping Byte to advertise with Meta, and Meta's performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven't specifically looked at it lately, but it's certainly not going to be any better than before.
The stage of Chinese companies burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just declining revenues, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not only looking at revenue, but more importantly, on future expectations.
Obviously, Meta's expectations were not enough.
To tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg told the "metaverse".
The meta-universe should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the meta-universe is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market value in these two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook's current very beautiful scenery, there is also an annual revenue of 100 billion to 200 billion US dollars, in fact, Facebook is now very crisis, compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is no good safe moat.
Although several of his social software are now relatively high in daily activity, they are also mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has no confidence, and subversion is the blink of an eye.
And the unattainable concept of the meta-universe has no hope of success in a short period of time, so Facebook is very dangerous, which is why Zuckerberg is changing the name of the company, and the fundamental reason why he is constantly looking for new tracks, but I think his track choice is wrong and a road of no return The above are some of my thoughts for reference.
