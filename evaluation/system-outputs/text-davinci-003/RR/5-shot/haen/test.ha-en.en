Reason for me leaving the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has stated some reasons why he left the PDP and joined the APC.
Don't forget that Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara defected from the PDP to the APC this week.
It is reported that he stayed to enjoy the patronage of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi State which helped him to win the 2019 election, then he gathered and left the party to return to the APC.
The main reason I left Bauchi state is how the PDP is ruling there.
Everyone knows the role I played in the gubernatorial election which the former Minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, unseated the incumbent Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I'm facing a dilemma with the government of Bala.
Instead of staying in the PDP they gave me what I deserved and told me to leave and go back to where I came from.
Reliance wrote a letter of resignation from the PDP which was sent to the male leader of the party, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he said that just as he had been warning other governors where they had failed and where they should fix it, he himself was not a slacker.
Za a iya barin ni tafiya in ƙyale su.
Fire broke out in a house in Kano.
The fire started around 10 pm and lasted for almost two hours, despite the efforts of the Kano State Fire Service, security personnel and the people of the town to put it out.
When Freedom Radio visited the site, it found people in awe and different security personnel at the site or elsewhere, as the site was connected to the major highway known as Kuka Highway, which transports passengers from Kano to other states and neighboring countries of the country.
In addition to the Water Gate Market that has emerged in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio interviewed some eyewitnesses who said the fire caused panic and fear among the people.
A traffic station at the Water Gate said they had collaborated with the police to evacuate passengers who had entered panic due to the flood.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, stating that at the time of this report it was still collecting information to ascertain the cause and extent of the fire, as stated by the agency's spokesperson Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim.
On the other hand, reports indicate that some burglars attempted to break into the Kofar Ruwa market to commit theft, but police and security personnel attempted to apprehend them and protect the public's property.
To this end, we contacted the Kano State Police Command Spokesperson, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
CORONA CURE: We have not yet completed the testing of the remedy formulated in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to conduct trials for the approval of Coronavirus treatments, Nigeria is not left behind in joining and conducting its own tests.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing 40 coronavirus-fighting drugs submitted to it by traditional medicine practitioners.
Director-General Mojisola Adeyeye announced that on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said tests are being done for the quality of medicines to avoid getting fake drugs.
Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, traditional medicine practitioners have been spurred to research in order to not be left behind in finding a cure for the disease.
Many of them have submitted their medicine samples to the government for testing and verification of its authenticity.
Haka kuma, NAFDAC ya sanya wa masu hada magani wasu sharudda da dokoki da za su bi.
Za a yi gwajin ingancin magungunan a dabbobi a farkon tukunna.
Mojisola warned practitioners not to recklessly administer any medication without permission from the authorities.
In May, NAFDAC announced that news of those claiming to have discovered a traditional cure for Coronavirus can only be seen on social media and newspaper websites.
Adeyeye stated that only one person has challenged the NAFDAC to examine the authenticity of the medicine he claimed to have composed of traditional ingredients, and that it could cure Coronavirus.
He too was that one person, not a cure he said he found.
That he found the cure for the symptoms of ill health that were seen as signs of infection.
However, since then some healers have been challenging the authority with their alliance.

Furthermore, he added that measures will be taken to ensure that the return of flights is successful by following all the necessary protocols.

APC Accuses Governor Neja of Attempting to Introduce Tarzoma in the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released yesterday, the APC party accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring division within the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Party Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that in the six years the party has been in power in the state, only Naira 512 million has been received.
The document went on to say that the meeting convened by the governor, which was chaired on Monday last week, will help to bring about unity in the party, where they said they have written to the national secretary of the party about the ongoing issues in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand that the Governor of Neja State is trying to divide the youth of the party by organizing a water and fire meeting, which is not based on any rules, for any complaints against the party leaders, to write to the party secretary, for them to investigate".
He continued to say that to date, in the six years since the party was founded, Naira 512 million is in the party's account.
He said what he understood as the governor was to be part of the national reconciliation committee set up on July 25, 2020, which the president had appointed to lead the arrangement of issues between the two parties and to resolve the court disputes between the two parties.
He said the funds we received were used to pay the salaries of the party's secretariat staff, and for other activities related to the party, such as organizing elections, resolving disputes, and providing health care assistance due to lack of access to government aid, without any party funds being spent inappropriately, and we challenge anyone to bring us evidence of misappropriation of party funds.
As I mentioned earlier, the local government elections that just took place are the most important elections that have been held in the country, with the former and current commissioners holding power in all twenty-five local governments in the state, with the funds spent on the elections being allocated to the commissioners to bring their constituencies.
Therefore, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent without any rules, this is almost an injustice and an attempt to give a bad name to it, saying that there is no committee set up to investigate how party funds are being spent and who set it up.
Among the funds the complainant alleged were misappropriated, were funds provided by the national party's treasurer, not any other funds, so I challenge any evidence he has to support this allegation in any way.
The Imam said we should stand firmly in defense of the APC party from any attempt by any individual or group to undermine the party, adding that any allegation against the party or any of its leaders from the state level should be referred to the disciplinary committee as provided for in Section 21 (B) (d) of page 82 of the party's constitution.
Therefore, the water-coolers of the party have no role to play especially when they attempt to seize control of the committee so their verdict has no effect.
For this reason, they are the approved leaders of the party in the state, as per Article 21 and Section 87 of the party's constitution, and any violation of this will not be tolerated.
Because the ruling of acquittal was wrongfully made by the judges.
He said those who presented themselves with consent at yesterday's meeting which did not improve, including Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, are not members of the party's approval committee in the state.
The Verification Committee of Water and Sewerage Party Chairman Engineer Mohammed Imam will be the only one to lead it, not the Governor will lead the party leaders of the state.
The document further stated that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello reminded of the promise made to the people of the state during the election, to travel with the party parents in government so that everyone will benefit from the state and all factions through the provision of political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
A commendation letter to the members of the National Assembly who have not attended the meeting and brought attention to the need for reconciliation on all issues between the members of the party, this is not surprising to the members who know their own hurt and have refused to accept any form of misconduct as party policy.
Therefore, there is a need for the National Executive Committee Chairman to draw Governor Abubakar Sani Bello's attention to the appropriate stance he should take in attempting to subvert the politics of the state.
Nigeria is Ready to Lead in the Digital Economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
Minister of Communications and Digital Economy Dr Isa Ali Pantami said that the country is ready to make a paradigm shift in the digital economy.
He also said that the government is ready to work with experts, academics, and other stakeholders to ensure that the country is kept abreast of all modern technological developments.
Dr. Isa Ali Pantami stated this during an international conference on the advancement of communication technology which was held via the internet.
The minister also added that one of the first steps the government has taken to ensure that the country is benefiting from the communication technology is to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy for Internet Economic Growth.
Yadda aikin hana abinci lalacewa ke taimakawa wajen kiyaye lafiyar mutane a Najeriya.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating food that has been treated with food preservatives that claim to prevent food spoilage, as eating such food can be detrimental to one's health.
Experts issued this warning after conducting a study on the quality of food consumed in this country.
The research results showed that there are some foods that are fortified with nutrients to prevent spoilage.
The research also showed that this material was used in fishing, rural farming and the sale of fresh fish to the public.
The material is being used so that when someone sees it they will be interested in buying it and using it.
Eating food containing this substance can also cause plague, typhoid fever, and other illnesses.
A call has been made to the people of this country to be mindful in avoiding the use of these kinds of food for their health.
If we remember rightly, food technologist Grace Olasumbo called on Nigerians to avoid eating fruits ripened with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo stated that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used catalyst by traders to ripen fruits, namely stone fruits.
Research shows that patience and perseverance are among the things that make traders use this medium to showcase their products in a day.
Olasumbo stated that what the market failed to recognize is the use of this material to demonstrate the potential of medical devices to cause harm to people.

An tsare shugaban bankin raya kasashen Afrika daga zargi - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The high-level panel chaired by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has cleared African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina of all charges.
According to the committee, Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of the charges of corruption leveled against him.
News agency AFP reported that earlier this year, a report of fifteen pages accused Mr. Adesina of sixty years of favoritism, mismanagement and self-enrichment.
However, the committee of experts led by Robinson, along with the Gambian Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and the Deputy Managing Director of the World Bank's Integrity Vice Presidency Leonard McCarthy, exonerated the former Nigerian Agriculture Minister from all the charges against him.
Previously, the United States had insisted that Mr. Adesina be investigated following allegations made against him by the African Development Bank's governing board, prompting the formation of a committee of eminent persons to conduct the investigation into the allegations.
COVID-19 Ya Haltar Yakin Neman Zaben Trump a Florida.
Yesterday, Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he was cancelling the major Republican convention that was scheduled to give him the nomination ticket in Jacksonville, Florida, in the coming weeks, due to the increasing cases of coronavirus.
Duk da haka, za a gudanar da ayyukan babban taron a jihar North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a large gathering was not appropriate at this time.
President Trump moved a portion of the GOP convention to Florida last month after they clashed with Democratic party leaders in North Carolina over holding the convention in an open venue with his supporters without requiring face masks.
Some representatives of the Republican Party will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially nominate Trump on August 24th.

President Muhammadu Buhari has also reiterated the measures suggested by the assembly to be taken to avoid gatherings of large numbers of people in one place.
For the small Eid celebration this year, the president performed his prayer at home with his family instead of going to the mosque as he usually does every year.

Achieving Food Security Goals for the Community - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the soul of life for all creatures, one cannot live without food.
This is why the Chinese authorities are increasing their efforts to ensure food security for the people of the country.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great successes in the field of food security, a feat that has amazed the world given the country's population which, according to estimates, has reached 1.4 billion Chinese.
This effort has greatly helped the cause of global hunger relief, as the head of China's State Administration of Grain, Zhang Wufeng, has previously stated that since 1949, China has always placed the issue of hunger relief at the forefront of all its national affairs.
But in recent days, some people and some media outlets in the western world have again "expressed concern" about whether China can effectively contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to the rest of the world?
We sincerely thank them for always taking care of Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved the goal of providing sufficient food through its efforts.
Providing food for the Chinese is one of the major agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last week, the Secretary-General of the JKS Committee, President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important directive to stop food waste, indicating that everyone knows that all food waste and labor are obtained.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its disruption to the world has brought hardship to China's economy, China will still be able to provide sufficient food for its people.
The statistics released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics regarding the amount of grain the country will obtain this year 2020 showed that the amount of rice obtained in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, or 3.9%, compared to the same period in 2019.
He also Ke Bingsheng, the former president of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that China has achieved great successes in terms of national wealth and food security when compared to the early stages of implementing the reform and opening up policy at home.
Huang Jikun, the director of the Institute of Agricultural Policy and Strategy at Peking University, told a reporter from The China Science Daily that the biggest challenge China is facing now is whether in the next two or three years, China can reduce the amount of grain and cotton stored in warehouses.
Now the average person in the world gets 474 kilograms of food per year instead of the 400 kilograms they should get.
And now China is importing millions of tons of grain for domestic livestock feed only.
Therefore, those who show concern should calm their minds, take a bath and go to bed, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
Chinese people can cook their own food with the ingredients they provide.
Abin da ya sa ake gurfanar da Ganduje a gaban kotu - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
PDP gubernatorial candidate Abba Kabir Yusuf has stated his reasons for prosecuting Kano State Governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and some businessmen in a high court.
Abba Kabir revealed this through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wuzirci, who stated that he filed the lawsuit, accusing the sale of some marketplaces owned by the government and benefiting the people of Kano State.
In addition to the Kano State Government and the market traders, Abba Kabir Yusuf also sued the state ministry of works, housing and transport, the state attorney general and commissioner of justice and the state urban and regional planning authority.
Governor Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State government of seizing some ancestral lands of the former Daula palace which are now under the care of the Wudil Science and Technology University and the Shahuci airstrip, which he said violates the laws of the country.
Aim for excellence only, in the grab-and-go system by 2023.
The President's Chief of Staff, Mamman Daura, has stated that the patchwork governance being practiced in Nigeria has become the old way of doing things now.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already done enough groundwork and now it should focus on selecting the most suitable candidate for 2023.
BBC Hausa ya wallafa wata hira da Mamman Daura ya yi inda ya bayyana haka.
This system of rotational presidency in Nigeria has not yielded a visible result since it was initiated in 1999.
Instead, Daura said to focus on selecting the right one rather than following this piecemeal approach.
Amma ƴan kabilar Igbo, wato Inyamirai, sun yi martani game da wannan kalamai na sa.
They said it was only when he and his brother President Buhari reconciled power that he would come out now he is giving advice not to follow that in 2023.
Buhari himself was not chosen by all Nigerians, he was elected.
Despite the fact that the senior security officials of this country have been sitting in their seats for many years, they are not better than the others in terms of performance.
Comparison of Inyamirai.
A political storm of criticism against the Nigerian presidency erupted on Wednesday as the Igbo Rights Group, Ndigbo, condemned Mamman Daura's statement on the Nigerian presidency's stance towards the Inyamurai tribe.
A taron magana da aka yi da Daura, wanda dan uwan Shugaba Muhammadu Buhari ne, ya ce za a yi tsarin shiyya-shiyya a zaben shugaban kasa da za a yi a 2023.
So in conclusion, even though words are not enough to address social media, Igbo people have quickly released a statement to honor Mamman Daura, and call for an end to racial discrimination.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo ethnic group in the South East and South-South regions of Nigeria will be allowed to produce the President in the 2023 elections, that is, the Igbo ethnic group.
Spokesperson of the Igbo Ethnic Group Zalla, Emeka Attamah said that Mamman Daura's words are like a declaration of Nigerian Presidency in 2023 to the Igbo people.
Aside from illness, what has prevented Mamman Daura from speaking out since 2019.
They ousted Jonathan and now Atiku is making a southern power bloc that will dominate Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
After he finishes restructuring what he inherited from his predecessor, the current head of state will come out with a surprise package in 2023 that we don't know about yet.
He should take it upon himself to embrace truth and hold it dear.
Not only does it come with a vision of leadership for the country in 2023, but also with a vision of love and compassion.
VOA Discussion Forum on Rape.
The issue of gender discrimination against children through sexual abuse has become a hot topic in Northern Nigeria where reports have emerged showing how children's rights are being violated.
People from various backgrounds attended the hall on July 23rd to discuss how the situation is worsening in the country and how it should be resolved.
The panelists linked the issue to things like the pressure put on girls and the strictness of some parents.
One of the mothers who attended the meeting of Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the widow of the former governor of Plateau and Niger states during the regime of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the reasons why parents impose restrictions on their children.
Hajiya Maryam Mamman Nasir, the leader of a group advocating against this menace, said "First of all, we need to educate parents, especially mothers, on the dangers of letting their children wander, because only when a child is gone can harm be done to them".
We also call on teachers to start preaching with a loud voice to parents and siblings who commit rape against their children and wards.
The Member of the House of Representatives representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse Constituency in Kebbi State, Honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed his concern and support for the enactment of a stringent law to punish anyone found guilty of rape in the country.
At the end of the session, Hajiya Madina Dauda and Nasiru El-Hikaya, who led the meeting, thanked those who attended the meeting on behalf of the Voice of America for accepting their invitation.
Contribution of 'Northern Media Writers' to Northern Unity.
Modern communication platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Skype and others have long been playing a major role in creating dialogue, connecting and bridging people from different parts of the world, sending messages, news, and disseminating political, educational and commercial agendas.
Youth in Nigeria have embraced this new technology of social media platforms to travel with the times, to give their contributions or voice their opinions on matters that affect their lives.
We can say that these developments have brought us many advances that the youth of the North are benefiting from in business, economic, educational and political affairs.
Many are taking food orders by typing and sending messages online, getting jobs done or developing projects they are working on.
Unfortunately, instead of using this opportunity to benefit from the progress made, some of the youth from the southern part of the country have resorted to fleeing the country and the world at large, engaging in criminal activities such as vandalism, extortion and disrespecting authorities and elders.
There is a lack of guidance, which is hindering the progress of the youth in this country.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers in the country is a great blessing, providing Northern youths with quality content and clean activities on Social Media, so that they can write meaningful articles and promote the goals of the Northern people.
It is incumbent upon us to give this association the collaboration it needs to achieve its noble objectives, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youths, especially those using social media, to come together to protect the North's dignity and provide a system that will bring change to all.
Just like our Northern leaders such as the Sardauna of Sokoto, the first Northern Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their contemporaries had the desire to provide for the people of the North.
It is reported that the late champion of justice and equity, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows their own home!
Therefore, we say that, as we call for the advancement of the nation and the improvement of the governance system, at every level, we further call for the unity of the people of the North, without any religious or tribal prejudice, to bring progress to our region.
Idan muka duba yadda Arewa ta kasance da ba haka take yanzu ba.
So we should use the wisdom that God has given us to provide the North with a sustainable path to economic prosperity.
Arewa should provide revenue sources to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to provide funds.
In order to further progress the North, we must give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
Ba za mu yi gudunmawa kawai ta hanyar biyan kudi ba, akwai hanyoyi daban daban na yin hakan.
We believe that this way North will fulfill our wishes!
North is our pride.
The government allocated 126 billion Naira for the renovation of hospitals in the country.
The Federal Government has allocated N126 billion from its economic stimulus plans to renovate hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be repaired include FMC Hospital, diagnostic centers, emergency care centers, isolation centers for those with contagious diseases, and teaching hospitals in the 36 states of the country.
In previous years, some stakeholders in the health sector have called on government agencies to join hands in mobilizing funds to improve the health sector of the country.
Experts made this call at a meeting to get consensus on providing quality healthcare to people in an easy and accessible way which was held in Abuja.
Answering the question of the Senator representing Kwara North under the umbrella of the APC party, Sadiq Umar said that it is necessary for the Nigerian government to take seriously the issues of improving the health of the nation.
He said that not doing so has caused the sector to suffer from financial problems, which has led to its reliance on foreign aid.
Umar said that despite all these aids they are receiving, there is no visible effort from the government in the health sector which has led them to start withdrawing the aid they are giving.

People who are starving in Africa will outnumber those killed by Coronavirus -IFAD.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has announced that an additional 23 million people are at risk of hunger in the Sahel region of Africa in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo made this statement at the Plenary Session on Economic Growth, of the World Economic Forum.

Houngbo said that research, forecasts and assessments of how to tackle the food crisis showed that in 2020, the number of people who will die from hunger in Africa will exceed those killed by the Coronavirus, by far.
IFAD is a renowned organization that specializes in supporting people living in rural areas to develop agriculture, providing them with nutritious food and generating income through farming.
Houngbo said that Coronavirus has shown that there are serious problems with the food supply system, distributing it and improving it.
Many farmers are struggling with how to get modern equipment due to travel restrictions.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has announced that the revenue generated from the export of crude oil and gas in June amounted to N378.42 billion, with N133.16 billion generated in May this year.
The Nigerian oil company added that this is an additional tax revenue that has been obtained since the Coronavirus outbreak in the world, which caused the imposition of travel restrictions and the drop in oil prices in the global market.
In a statement by the company's Head of Public Relations, Dr. Kennie Obateru, he signed off by saying that NNPC had declared that, within the NNPC, it had recorded an increase in revenue from oil and gas sales amounting to N4.60 trillion between June 2019 and June 2020.

This group investigates reports published by credible media outlets, as well as information gathered from family members, relatives, or acquaintances of those killed that have not been reported in the press.
The recent reports released by the organization showed that states of Borno, Kaduna and Katsina were the most affected by killings in Nigeria in the month of July.

Minister of Agriculture Alhaji Sabo Muhammad Nanono has challenged state governments and local governments on the security issue in Nigeria.
A interview da ministan yayi da Hausa Department na Radio France International game da yadda matsalar tsaro ta shafi ɓangaren noma.
The Minister said "The truth is that it is not only the federal government that has the right to security in this matter, but also state governments and local authorities, if you go down to the states, districts and villages, they have all taken it upon themselves to make this security situation what it is, but everyone stands up and says it is the federal government".
Well, the federal government has the right to regulate the lives of the people, but those who are close to these people should have started the conversation that we see a problem with these issues from the beginning.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono further added that the federal government is committed to its efforts to improve agriculture and food security in the country.
President Trump Signs Executive Order on Drug Pricing.
On Friday, July 24th, President of the United States Donald Trump signed four executive orders to reduce the amount of money Americans spend on prescription drugs, as he faces a legal battle to overturn the election and challenge his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
Previously, Trump had said he would almost immediately sign the executive order he put his hand to on Friday, but this is the first time the order has been signed.
One of the regulations will allow for the importation of prescription drugs from countries like Canada legally, while another regulation will require drug companies to reduce their prices, according to Trump.
A fourth regulation, which could not be implemented if the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies are successful, would require the Medicare insurance system to purchase drugs at the same prices as other countries, according to Trump. It would also require a reduction in the cost of insulin.
A Nigerian Got an Award from the UNICEF Competition.
Over 80,000 youths from Nigeria have joined a UNICEF Children's Fund support program, taking on the burden of creating a technology solution to the COVID-19 pandemic and providing solutions to the public, which they have called the "UNICEF COVID-19 Innovation Challenge".
Those who received awards from Nigeria range from 14 to 35 years old.
One of the youths named Chukwuma Nwachukwu, aged 28, presented how to use solar energy to provide water to help fight against the virus.
The sun-powered fan designed by Chukwuma Nwachukwu was successful in the first round of the competition.
Chukwuma Nwachukwu said his goal is to provide clean drinking water to the communities of Abuja who do not have access to clean water.
Nwachukwu is among the Nigerian youths who entered the "UNICEF COVID-19 Innovation Challenge" which was launched in May and has been running for six weeks.
UNICEF said that new innovations demonstrate how youth can contribute greatly when entering difficult times.
Approximately 60 million Nigerians, or nearly one-third of the country's population, do not have access to safe drinking water, according to the Water Aid Agency.
Kano Citizens Sue Ganduje Over Buhari - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A coalition of civil society groups in Kano has filed a lawsuit against Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to President Muhammadu Buhari over his plan to borrow from a Chinese bank to build a railway line.
A coalition of over 15 groups under the Kano Forum umbrella has expressed what it calls a strong opposition to the government of Ganduje's plan to construct the first phase of a railway line in Kano as something that is of no use given the major challenges facing the state.
The group alleged that Governor Ganduje will collect a loan of 684 million euros, equivalent to about three billion naira, which they said the government will not be able to pay off in 50 years.
The Chairman of the Group, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, said it is almost impossible to say that Kano State has taken on a heavier burden than what was already imposed on it in the past.
Abin Da Ya Fi Dacewa Don Magance Fyade A Nijeriya Shine Maigidaje -Maigidaje.
An Alumni of Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, has suggested that the only solution to the issue of rape in Nigeria, especially in the Northern part of the country, is to impose the death penalty on those convicted of rape.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje announced this in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, where he added that if the government confirms this after investigation, the only solution is to impose the death penalty.
He added that the ruling will reduce the amount of rape that can be obtained, but the biggest relief is for us to change our minds.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, he urged us to stand firm in our faith as Muslims, to be devoted to Allah and His Prophet, for no one knows when they will die.
He said it was shameful to say that an adult man or an old man should get a small girl or a three-year-old or five-year-old girl and rape her.
He went on to say, between God and us, we should not criticize rulers or kings, implying that no progress can be made in a country if such disrespect is present.
He added that this is why we are in a state of lock down and difficulty in the country, for the country to progress, the rulers, governors and president have no idea how to handle the situation.
He added that they had to demolish that building and then another one came up, so it was necessary for us to change our minds so that God could bring us a solution to the rape issue.
He declared that, even if it is done for safety, everything should be submitted to Allah for He is the one who relieves all distress and poverty for the people.
According to him, no matter what situation you are in, Allah knows you and nothing you do will escape His notice, so always be mindful and always think that you will die and always think that you have a past, if you have done something wrong then you must repent.
It has been noted that, the police in their efforts to send those accused of rape to the court of law have been doing their best in this regard which has become a menace in our Northern Nigeria region and in the country at large.
He called on parents in particular to keep a close eye on their children, citing examples of the excessive demands that parents place on their daughters, which can lead to problems.
He said that some parents do not monitor the lives of their children, whether they go to school or not, or come home on time or not, adding that part of the blame lies with some parents because they should know that Allah has given them children and on the Day of Judgment He will ask them what kind of upbringing they gave their children.

Rice farmers in Benue State are expecting to make a lot of harvest in about two weeks after planting.
Some of those discussed in Makurdi expressed hope that the harvest would be at any time between October and November.
A small-scale farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko town in the state, Titus Atondo, said he planted rice on a two-hectare plot in July.
Atondo said he sourced the grains from the market in his area and they are in two categories of CP and OC rice while using the Dazzle material to share files for cutting and carving.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in drylands are many because we rely heavily on manual labor as farmers cannot access mechanization.
Titus Atondo further added that we are taking people to do farming from the grassroots level up to harvest, further adding that this is tedious and laborious.
Atondo said all the money spent on his farm which is now in operation include planting, harvesting, modern equipment and it is expected to reach N2020,000.
Titus Atondo continued, however, he expected at least a bundle of 50 as a bundle from the two bales that will likely be sold at a price of Naira 29,000 per bundle of 100k.
Another major rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, also planted paddy in June to July on an area of 274 hectares with a price of N14,500 per hectare while the field rate is paying N25,000 per hectare.
It sourced 44 (Supi) and Faro 61 (OC) varieties obtained from the National Root Crops Research Institute (NRCRI) and some were sourced from Olam Nigeria Company.
He added that, the levels of growth at this time are in different fields while some are in the process of harvesting, some are in the initial stages of animal slaughter as is the case with crop farming in stages.
The report further states that the challenges so far have been financial since the cost of procuring the selected animals is high and the cost of fodder has increased.
He said the harvest is expected to start from October to November.
He added that the total cost of the equipment at the end of the day will be the least Naira 246,000 per unit while a supply of three tons is expected which will translate to Naira 360,000 on a Naira 120 per kilo basis.
The expert does not use chemicals on the rice field, instead he provides advice and implements traditional farming, where he adds that, therefore, we use very efficient weed killers, herbicides and insecticides.
The President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) of Benue State, comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed his hope that the weather this year will be conducive for the cultivation of a lot of rice.
According to the President of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) in Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers have entered the rice farming business at the end of this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic which has prevented many people from leaving their offices and staying at home.
He said, I will take up 20 out of 100 of the goods produced in 2019 which was estimated to be over one million.
According to him, currently the data collectors are taking readings from different farmers and when the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The Chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) in Benue State, Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said he farms three hectares of rice farm, noticed that some farmers harvested their rice in June while those who farm on short-term basis do so at the expected time at the end of November or early December.
The AFAN President further stated that farmers are using chemicals to kill pests, weeds, and herbicides.
He expressed his concern about the pests that threaten rice farming, adding that farmers are using traps with bait to address the problem.

Furthermore, the governor stated that it has enabled them to distribute the stimulus packages to the employee unions in the state.
His Royal Highness the Emir of Kano Alh Aminu Ado Bayero thanked Allah for the decrease in the spread of this Covid 19 virus in Kano State.
He also urged the ummah to continue to support the government in ending the pandemic with prayers for those who have lost their lives.
He advised people to perform their prayers with caution and take precautions against contracting Covid 19.
You should continue to follow the safety guidelines set by health authorities especially in places of worship.
"Any books that are not necessary should be discarded at all times," said the King of Kano.
In his address, the first Commissioner of Health of the state, Dr. Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa, commended the state government for the measures it is taking to contain the spread of this Corona virus.
Furthermore, there has been a decrease in those infected with this virus, and various government departments and independent organizations have praised the government's efforts in combating the Covid 19 virus.
At the discussion, the state's Commissioner for Environment, Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, said that in addition to the fumigation carried out in government offices, private homes and businesses, they have so far distributed more than one million mosquito nets to prevent malaria.

The issue of gender parity and national laws that have been put in place to ensure equal access for women to participate in elections that are conducted in a way that they can effectively contribute to the governance process was one of the important topics discussed at the CNDP meeting, as Dr Dita Idrissa, spokesperson for the MRN political party in Niger, explained.
The new generation political parties, which are called our new forces, also agree with this policy of bringing women into politics, starting from the issue of giving them tickets to vote in political parties, as the president of these associations, Malam Hambali Dodo, has stated.
Re-examining the electoral system under which elections are conducted in Nigeria was one of the demands the participants of this meeting came with, according to them it is a way to curb malpractices.
However, this requirement was not met, as according to the election commission any form of campaigning at this time is a violation of the law.
Opponents of those continuing to defy all electoral regulations did not attend this meeting, an action attributed to the illegality they claimed had been committed by the CENI electoral commission.
It is expected that the local government elections will be held on December 13th, 2020, with the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections taking place two weeks later on the 27th.

Nigerian students in Cyprus have refuted Abike Dabire's claim that students are being subjected to genocide in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, TRCN, have criticized the Chairman of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), for warning their parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus, saying they are being subjected to exploitation.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa issued this warning that thousands of Nigerians are being killed in Northern Cyprus without the government of the country conducting thorough investigations.
The authority made this statement after the news of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel was received.
The student who was Nigerian was killed and no further information has been heard yet.
The murder of Ibrahim Khaleel should be a lesson to parents to stop sending their children into the world, to be killed in vain, especially in the Northern Cyprus country.
The problem is that people don't realize that the world does not recognize the existence of a Northern Cyprus.
The United Nations does not approve of the country either.
But many Nigerians are living in their country studying, yet thousands of Nigerians are being killed in the country.
The Minister said that Nigeria will reveal the names of thousands of Nigerians who have been victims of killings in the country.
However, as they voiced their dissent, Nigerian students studying in the country said that peace in Northern Cyprus is better than in Nigeria, far away and not close.
The President of the National Association of Nigerian Students Abroad (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, said that although Nigerian students in foreign countries are facing challenges, students in Northern Cyprus are not facing any problems, challenges or obstacles.
This was the evidence presented to PREMIUM TIMES in the interview they conducted.
Ya ce ba daidai ba ne da ta ce daruruwan daliban Najeriya sun mutu a Cyprus.
He said the news of the student's death was 100% false.
Most of those who died were accident-related, not homicide.

Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi has announced that the resumption of the Abuja-Kaduna train service will take place on the 29th of July this year.
Amaechi made this announcement while testing some new aircrafts that will be flying between Kaduna and Abuja today Saturday.

Discussions on Conflict Resolution in Mali.
Five of the leaders of West African countries have begun a meeting this Monday to discuss the political crisis in the country of Mali.
The meeting, which is the third since the outbreak of the conflict, will focus on finding a solution between President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and opposition leader Imam Mahmoud Dicko.
The initiative taken by the Heads of State of Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, and led by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, all failed.
According to the ECOWAS, no agreement has been reached on the position despite their disapproval of the coup that ousted IBK from power.
Now eyes are on to see how it will play out.
The religious leaders exhort their followers to truth and not to be disturbed.
The Kaduna State House of Assembly Spokesperson, Yusuf Zailani, has urged religious leaders to always tell their followers the truth instead of misleading them in places of worship and creating disharmony.
Zailani stated this while delivering a speech at the Kaduna State Government House conference room during the reception of the Nigerian Christian Association leaders who visited Kaduna yesterday.
Zailani also added that "It is true that we do not like to talk about it, if you go to some places of worship you will hear their leaders preaching and then they are insulting their fellow believers who are not of their religion.
That is what causes conflict between people.
Finally, he said that we must come together and religious leaders should teach the followers the message of Allah the Almighty as it is written in our religious books, or else there will be no peace.
Similarly, the representative of Central Kaduna, Uba Sani who attended this meeting requested that those who are not residents of Kaduna should be mindful of their words before speaking.
This conflict has been going on for over 40 years.
For the first time, a governor was elected who put an end to this problem.
But because some people are spinning the story to fit their own narrative, many people are only hearing one side of the story, not the other.
Many N-Power beneficiaries are benefiting from the program.
Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Sadiya Farouk has stated that many of the beneficiaries of the N-Power, the Cash Allawance Scheme, are working in some places, according to research.
In her statement on Thursday, the Minister confirmed that there are indeed those who have not been paid but the issue did not originate from her office, as her office has already submitted the names of over 500,000 people to be verified and paid their arrears.
It is said that there are certain names that are used to bypass the authority, they receive money after working in certain places.
This scheme is for those without jobs but some of those receiving allowances are actually working in some places and receiving the N-Power allowance.
Now tracing and tracing is being done to identify them and to pay them from among those who are to be paid.
Requesting beneficiaries of the program who have not been paid to kindly bear with us that they will soon receive their tools.

The Human Rights Activist, Comrade Mustapha Soron Dinki, who traveled from Kano to Abuja with the youths said this protest was done to remind the minister of the rights of those benefiting from the scheme before they are stopped.

People Praise The King, I Receive Their Praise.
The film filled with songs by Beyonce titled "Black is King", which celebrates the resilience of Black people and their culture around the world, for how it is portrayed in African tradition.
In South Africa, where this 85-minute film was released, many people said it was even better than a movie.
Black is King, a musical film featuring songs by renowned American singer and songwriter Beyonce, who also directed, produced, and executive produced the project.
This film has been a hit like the soundtrack titled "The Lion King: The Gift", or Sarakin Zaki: Ɗan Baiwa.
The movie was filmed in America, West Africa, and Europe, and it featured many African musicians.
This movie, released in July, received positive reviews from viewers, but also some criticism.
Some say that Beyonce, born in Houston, Texas in the US, appropriated African elements without context, particularly in her film, despite having no ancestral ties to the African continent.
But in South Africa, there is even more joy for those who took part in making this film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film studies student, said he was honored to be included in the filmmaking team.
Ya ce fim ɗin ya burge shi.
The movie touches on many topics that are not taught in school about the history of black people.
He said when he saw the movie he began to see the story and the costumes she was wearing and the whole movie, which brought many things to light more than what was planned to happen.
King Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce's music, said that Africans in diaspora - including African-American youth - have the opportunity to use what some consider African cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the movie.
The King said that women should be given lower positions in society.
So their followers in matters of great influence, it is a strengthening bond.
The student reading how to make films, Mathebula said that the Beyonce movie made him interested in making his own film to spread awareness about Africa.
African fans of Beyonce have agreed on one thing: If the King is a Man, then Beyonce is the Queen.

Also, she has taken into consideration that in this year alone, she has learned important lessons and gained new insights into the ways of engaging and disengaging in this work.
Praising the media outlets, the minister said these outlets are travel companions that must be strongly connected with in order to succeed.
She said, "I want to tell you all today that the work you are doing is right."
She also said that it was not her obligation to give her colleagues rewards for their successes, but she was ready with her colleagues to continue their work with dedication and commitment to fulfill their promises of service, which is in line with their core mission of Service2Humanity.
The Minister expressed special appreciation to the “aid workers and our partners in this sector from UN agencies such as OCHA, IOM, UNHCR and WHO. The World Food Programme, World Bank, USAID and the European Union (EU), as well as other partner organizations who continue to provide assistance despite the insecurity and hardships they face.
It also took a toll on those who lost their lives in the insecure areas this past year.
The Minister stated that the one year anniversary of the establishment of the ministry necessitated a thorough review.
She said, "As we celebrate our first year, I want to say that it is time for us to re-energize our efforts in carrying out our work."
We must find ways to expand our crime prevention, provide assistance and develop public assistance programs that will help us improve our work in the future.
At the same time that farmers are struggling to reap their harvests in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto State have begun to complain about the infestation of pests that are beginning to cause them harm, which could bring about a decrease in the expected yields.
The prospects of farmers in the Sokoto State area are seen as a blessing in disguise, as signs of a good harvest this 2020 year have been seen.
Of course, some local farmers adopted a traditional method of controlling pests as a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni region explained.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the area's farmers, said that the rodents are now wreaking havoc on all the crops they have started to invade.
The Chairman of the Nigerian Farmers Association in Sokoto State, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that currently two-thirds of Sokoto State are facing this problem.
He also said they are now waiting to hear the situation of the small local governments in the state to compile a report to be sent to the state and federal agriculture ministry for taking measures to help the farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture's Director of Pest Control, Ya'u Maƙeri Kagara, stated that the completion of the pest control exercise in the Sokoto area is not more than one week away.
He added that the refugees were coming from Niger Republic and Benin Republic, and that international relations must have an agreement before tackling the problem.
In June, the federal government launched a de-worming project in 12 northern Nigerian states bordering foreign countries from which worms are entering Nigeria.
However, re-emerging of this problem may set back the progress seen in the agricultural sector which governments claim to be giving special attention.

A Sabon COVID-19 Relief Bill Za a Gabatar a Amurka.
As data shows that the number of those infected with COVID-19 continues to rise in America, today Monday it is expected that Republican members of the US House of Representatives will present a relief bill.
It is thought that the bailout will bring in one trillion dollars to alleviate the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan is to arrive days ahead of the expiration of the first round of stimulus money for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Yesterday, after days of negotiations with Republican lawmakers in Congress, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the relief package would include an expansion of the program to provide money to those who have lost their jobs.
But according to them, in this case, Americans will see a 70 out of 100 of the funds that were given to them previously.
On Friday the first round of relief will end, with some payments made to those who lost their jobs, and an additional $600 per week provided by the states.
The Republicans are complaining that this scheme means some people are getting paid twice, receiving both federal and state government aid when they are working.
But Democrats in their camp have challenged this statement, arguing that with the increasing spread of the coronavirus, some employees do not have the peace of mind to be able to return to work.
Reason for Returning to APC After Leaving PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has stated the reasons for his switch from the PDP to the APC after the President's Deputy Party Leader Mai Mala Buni announced his return to the party.
In a letter written to the PDP in his constituency of Bogoro, Dogara stated that his resignation from the Bauchi State Government under Governor Bala Muhammed, which helped to achieve success, is the reason for his departure from the party.
He argued that he could not open his mouth to question how the government of the state was being run without being accused of disloyalty, so he resigned from the party.
The former Speaker said that if he were to take up arms, he would guarantee that everything would be done according to the way things are done in Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed government, after during the time of Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar everyone heard his voice and expressed his opinion if he saw something wrong.

The program will also increase farmers' access to food improvement, transformation and distribution channels in Nigeria.
According to the Minister, this launching ceremony of the scheme represents more than 1,100,000 small farmers across the country.
He said that these smallholder farmers, over 1,100,000 in number, are part of the Farmer Network under 6 companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
Immediately we will explain the second group of B, those who will benefit from this rental scheme.
Herein lies a reminder of how President Muhammadu Buhari established the Economic Sustainability Committee to tackle the economic fallout from the Coronavirus pandemic.

He said the program includes the government's food rationing metric of up to 100,000 for the relief of the most vulnerable from food insecurity during the Coronavirus pandemic.
He said that within one year this ambitious project is expected to provide 5 to 10 million jobs to the youth.
And it will provide food for up to 10 metric tons per hectare from 20,000 to 100,000 in each region, benefiting at least 2.4 million farmers.

Discussion on the New Regulation of Places of Worship Registration in Nigeria.
The SERAP human rights and economic development advocacy group has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately suspend the Nigerian Attorney General Abubakar Malami and the Director General of the Corporate Affairs Commission to halt the planned registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, this action is a violation of human rights as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.
Before human rights organizations protested this government action, religious leaders from different faiths had already presented their grievances to the Buhari government, that the House of Representatives should reconsider and approve this law, so that it does not conflict with the religious freedom and tolerance provided by the constitution.
Pastor John Buro, the head of Christians in Kaduna State, told a Muryar Amurka reporter that this law does not have a basis, but if the government is trying to restrict worship or impose restrictions.
Duk da haka, dole ne a yi amfani da hanyoyin da suka dace don gano da kuma bincika duk masu laifi ba tare da sanya wata sabuwar doka ba.
On his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the Vice Chancellor of Science at Minna University said that while it is right for the government to keep an eye on companies and organizations for national security, that does not mean that it should be done at the expense of infringing on the rights of any individual or group.
Now all that remains to be seen is if the government will heed this public outcry.
Yadda Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) ya yi kokarin kawar da shafin PREMIUM TIMES a kan yanar gizo.
The Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) has taken up the responsibility of blocking access to the PREMIUM TIMES website, a renowned online newspaper in Nigeria.
This comprehensive review of web hosting services attempted to do all the tactics that hackers use to access people's websites, but it was unsuccessful.
He began his hacking activities, or "hacking", on February 28th, where he infiltrated the university's computer systems, and he continued his attacks by using the university's "data".
On the other hand, if he tried to hack the PREMIUM TIMES internet server, he then launched another attack with his GSM phone.
Five days he tried to break into the main portal of PREMIUM TIMES, but he failed, despite using various modern technology tools.
It failed to break in, because the university was unaware that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had a robust security system, which it had built to be impenetrable and unbreachable by any ordinary intruder.
Additionally, PREMIUM has a team of modern cyber security experts including PREMIUM TIMES Warlord, Chief Editor of PREMIUM TIMES and Chief Webmaster of PREMIUM TIMES.
These security personnel are well-versed in thwarting any malicious attack or any attempt to infiltrate and cause havoc, or to steal data, in the PREMIUM TIMES Database.
Abubuwan Da Dan Shigar-kutsen Intanet Ya Rika Kai Wa Shafin PREMIUM TIMES Hari Da Su:
At 8 pm, the PREMIUM TIMES Main Compound gate began to swing open, to see how it would make a way for the convoy to enter, and to dismantle the compound entirely.
After failing to succeed in the night, the next morning at 6:15 he tried again, this time using "WPScan", what is used to detect vulnerabilities or lack of security measures of major websites like PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes he began to attempt to extract the data using modern computer technology, known as "custom script".
And he did all he could by way of computer hacks to completely shut down the PREMIUM TIMES website.
Yadda za a Magance Mabarnaci na Biyu:
This plugin developer did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had conducted a comprehensive investigation into the small and large bots that enter the domain of modern communication to block pages or delete pages.
This lack of knowledge is what has made all the equipment he used, all vintage cameras that could not give PREMIUM TIMES any fault or blame.
On this day he faced difficulty and exhaustion to follow the path of attack with DDOS in the NTP Network, an old route that has been used since the ancient town of Kano.
On March 3rd he tried every method to reduce his computer and thinking load, but none of them were successful.
This hacking attempt on the PREMIUM TIMES main server came days after PREMIUM TIMES published a report of a power tussle between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari.
Some students of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have told PREMIUM TIMES that the university has hired some hackers to attack the PREMIUM TIMES website and to damage or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, it distanced itself from this attempt to evade the PREMIUM TIMES main Internet Hub.
FUTA stated that only if a student is a self-sponsored student at the university should he/she try to do it alone, not with FUTA's help.

As the Kano State Government reduced its budget for the year by about N70 billion due to the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the state's economy, the state's House of Assembly enacted a new law governing the management of the state government's finances.
However, city governance groups say that creating the law is easy, but implementing it is the challenge.
Creating a new channel for government funds disbursement under a democratic system is one of the objectives of the new law in Kano State which has been in existence for some years now at both the federal and other states in Nigeria.
The Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Honorable Kabiru Hassan Dashi, has told Voice of America that the law will give employees and the state government guidelines on how to spend their money, as well as how the state will monitor its expenditure.
Now, the city's civic organizations have welcomed the ordinance, provided that it is enforced consistently.
The Director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement based in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali, stated that they hope government officials and the state government will implement the law as it should be.
But the Kano State Commissioner of Finance and Economic Planning, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they have prepared adequately to work with the new regulations.
Recently, the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, signed this new law at the end of last week, and it is expected to take effect immediately.

He said the four remaining tasks for INEC include issuing the election notice for the upcoming Tuesday, presenting the names of the candidates of each party that will be running, all on the same day.
And stop campaigning 24 hours before the election.
To, za a tsaya kamfen 12 na Alhamis, kafin Asabar da za a yi zabe.
So we just have to wait and see, and wait for the election day.

The meeting also affirmed the assurance given by the Nigerian government to every Nigerian citizen to reside and move freely in any part of the country, including the Atyap Chiefdom, without fear or any form of molestation from anyone.
The meeting also called on governments to facilitate the repatriation of all displaced persons to their homes.
The meeting also suggested the formation of a peace committee that would include the ethnic groups, Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youths to organize major rallies and discussions on issues related to providing security from time to time to promote peace in their emirate.
A peace and reconciliation meeting is coming up in the next few days after the Kaduna State Government issued an edict on the restriction of movement imposed on the local government areas of Zangon Kataf and Kaura in the state to curb the outbreak of violence among the inhabitants of the area.
Yadda Ganduje zai mayar da hakimai da Sarki Ado da Sanusi suka kori, zai mayar da su masu nada sarakuna a Kano.

The reinstated Emirs of Kano are Aminu Babba Ɗan'agundi and Sanusi Ado-Bayero, who was the Sarkin Dawaki Mai Tuta and Ciroman Kano.
Both King Ado and King Muhammadu Sanusi removed them, on the accusation of corruption.
Father Danagundi challenged the court to arrest him.
The 17-year-old was facing charges until the High Court ruled that he should be acquitted.
He also wants Ganduje to take over the throne, and to amend the law to make him one of the rulers of the Kano Emirate.
Sultan Bayero was removed in 2003 after being accused of corruption and interference in politics.
A committee was set up to investigate it, but he was invited to appear before the committee to defend himself.
Daga nan ya yi kara zuwa Babbar Kotun Jihar Kano har zuwa Kotun Koli.
Before the Court of Appeal, the Federal High Court had ruled to reinstate Aminu Babba to his seat.

Effort and Perseverance in Pursuit of Excellence is in the Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In the Longyuan Village of Hongsipu District in Wuzhong City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, in northern China.
There is a famous woman named Li Yaomei or Sadia (her Muslim name) who is renowned for her struggles in life and her success in escaping poverty.
The labyrinth tells us that effort, perseverance and seeking are all within the heart.
To begin with, neither Li Yaomei nor Sadiya had ever been to school with the intention of learning, which is why she couldn't read or write.
May Allah grant her wisdom and insight and abundant wisdom, where she has become an example in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from uterine fibroids, which led to her undergoing surgery 3 times.
After her accident, she encountered a terrible disaster, and now she is traveling with a cast on her arm.
These challenges she faced put her in a dire situation regarding her health, even down to the issue of medication, which is why she received a compensation of around 3 million Yuan, equivalent to about 16 million Naira.
Surprisingly, this challenge that Mrs. Sadiya faced gave her a way to reflect and rethink in order to improve her life.
Furthermore, the subsidy provided by the Chinese government gave her more confidence.

Due to her efforts, the business has grown significantly, where different employees are giving her donations.
In addition, it creates multiple interfaces that help her streamline her work.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to connect one big cable, but now in this time, it can connect up to 5 cables.
In addition, it provides additional cleaning devices that reduce the amount of dust it emits.

From the challenges that Madam Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her employees, it can be understood that indeed she seeks and finds success.
Fighting poverty and improving life is not something that rests solely on government.
If the government is to provide aid, but people have no motivation or interest in improving their lives by taking initiative themselves based on their current situation, then it will only be a cycle of back and forth without achieving any goal.
The maze indicates that conducting a business or job to earn income does not require any large investments or trips to other cities or countries.
Taking into account her circumstances, she uses the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, teacher Sadiya carried out these tasks independently and without relying on her husband, as he had left her.
In other words, effort, perseverance and striving are in the heart.
It also demonstrates the strength women have to change their lives and stand up for themselves without seeking help from anyone else.
This lesson also shows that whatever one does, one should stand by one's convictions, for relying on another is not certain.
Truly, Mrs. Sadiya was a diligent, intelligent and hardworking woman who was an example and an inspiration to others.
Also, by March of this year, Madam Sadiya had paid off all the debts she was owing, and stopped receiving government aid on her own accord.

There is Fear American Politicians Will Sabotage Efforts to Contain COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Recently, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern over the measures taken by some countries to restrict access to the COVID-19 vaccine, stating that it is essential to avoid showing favoritism to certain nations while distributing the vaccine.
And it should be shared through the appropriate channels around the world, as this would be in line with the larger objectives of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are pursuing a strategy of self-interest in terms of the distribution of vaccine resources, as well as criticizing the cooperation between countries in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has already surpassed 23 million.
In terms of numbers, there are people who have lost their lives due to the disease exceeding 800.
Under such a severe situation, attention is being paid to the effect of vaccine on the virus, and the good news is that, in recent days, great progress has been made in the research of vaccine in some countries, which brings hope and belief to the whole world.
But the downside is that some American politicians have shown a desire to seize the uranium.
Even the journal "Science" has reported that the US government has already negotiated contracts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for more than $6 billion from various pharmaceutical companies.
Although the purpose of the US government is understood, being the leader in vaccine distribution, other developing countries also need access to vaccines, given that they suffer from a lack of healthcare resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also noted that if the US achieves its goal of procuring renewable energy, the amount of renewable energy procured by developing countries will decrease.
Kuma, Babban Daraktan Cibiyar Dakile Cututtuka ta Afirka CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, ya nuna damuwa kan wannan batun.
As some commentators on current affairs have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, the goal of overcoming the pandemic cannot be achieved unless there is a plan for distributing the vaccine, which is a critically important issue for countries around the world.
And it is fitting for the countries of the world to strengthen their cooperation between them.
The WHO Director-General Tedros also emphasized that in order to see an end to the pandemic, it must be tackled from all angles around the world, not just allowing some parts of the world or a few countries to reach the goal of overcoming the effects of the virus.

An yi jigilar jigilar gwamnatin Buhari da suka raka gawar Abba Kyari a Kotu.
A Nigerian rights activist has accused President Muhammadu Buhari's government of desecrating the grave of Abba Kyari.
Yesterday, Abba Kyari, who was the Chief of Staff to the President of Nigeria, was buried at the Gudu Cemetery in Abuja on the 18th of April, after he died from Coronavirus.
Tope Akinyade, the prosecutor, presented them to the Magistrate Court in Kado, Abuja, where he asked the court to convict them for violating the lockdown regulations imposed by the federal government at the time.
He said there was an unfairness to Nigerians who were being subjected to enforcement of lockdown regulations, but for some large gatherings, laws were broken and none of them were punished.
He said that if the Buhari government is fair in its enforcement, then he does not see any reason why people should be punished and fined if they violate the Corona regulations.
They and some other parts of the government have broken the law but were allowed to.
Among those Tope presented to court are the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development, Sadiya Umar.
There are also the Presidential Spokesperson, Garba Shehu, the Social Media Adviser, Bashir Ahmed, the Presidential Adviser on Security Matters, Babagana Monguno, the Chief of Army Staff, Mohammed Adamu and many other government officials.
Judge Celestine Odo argued that the prosecutor had made a mistake since the defendants he was prosecuting had not signed the complaint against them.
But Tope reminded the Magistrate that he should bring the case directly to court, without any intervention from the police.
He said the sheriff sent out summons to all those involved in the case to put their hands up.
Don yin abin da doka ta Najeriya ta ba shi ikon yin wajen shigar da karar a kotu.
The Judge adjourned the hearing, saying to return to court on August 4th, to continue the hearing.

The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, made this announcement in a statement he issued on Friday.
In response to a statement issued to the National Chairman of the PDP, calling for the impeachment of President Buhari.
The leader said, at the same time when the world was uniting to fight a common enemy, the opposition party in Nigeria, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP began its electoral campaign.
This policy, which is contrary to the country's governance system, calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to grant permission for investigations into several government offices, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which is responsible for fighting economic crimes in the country.
According to the statement of the party chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they want the president to stop the investigation but to close the issues.
Prepare to wake up from sleep as one of their leaders has spoken.
PDP cannot intimidate the government from imposing harsh charges on MDAs and their leaders because failing to do so would be a breach of public trust.

The President of South Africa Has Rejected the Sanctions Imposed on Corruption.
The President of South Africa has spoken out against corruption due to the rampant corruption in the ruling ANC party of the country.
In a letter he wrote on Sunday, August 23, and sent to all members of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa began by addressing the issue of providing relief to the country in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
What has brought about this disparity is the presence of independent companies and individuals, including government officials, who have used the hospital equipment issue, social welfare and economic resources to benefit themselves, according to the letter.
This betrayal of millions of South Africans by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing hunger daily and lack of employment, will not be forgiven.
In his letter, Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of the country's funds have been discovered that should be used to improve transportation, provide basic necessities of life to the poor, and improve the quality of electricity, help small-scale farmers who are struggling, and develop the entire country, which the militants have stolen and put in their pockets.
President Ramaphosa said that people should not think that the ANC is just a way to gain power, wealth, or fame.

The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics announced that the country's economy has seen a rebound that has not been seen in the past 10 years, as a result of the rebound that exceeded 6 percent between April and June of this year.

The agency listed the causes of the problem including mandating people to stay at home across the country, banning air travel, suspending flights, closing schools and shops.
The agency added that taking such measures in countries around the world has caused the price of oil to drop, while factories in countries around the world have been closed to tackle the problem.

Yadda za a Sake Kama daga Yan Sanda - Famous Short Story.
The notorious criminal wanted by the police for killing people, Sunday Shodipe, has revealed how he managed to escape from the Mokola Police Station in Ibadan, Oyo State on Tuesday.
The suspect said a new police chief, who was brought in to the police station recently, ordered an officer named Funsho to leave and take a bath.
He told the officer to caution him against attempting to escape while he was bathing, adding that at that time he had not thought of fleeing either.
Evidence showed that he succeeded in escaping when he noticed that the officer's attention was diverted away from him during the conversation with another person and he was not paying attention to him.
He said this new DPO woman that was brought in demanded Funsho to allow me to do laundry.
Ya yi mini gargadi akan kada na yi kokarin guduwa lokacin da nake wanka.
I was surprised when I saw him talking to someone.
I climbed on top of the bus and then I jumped off.

He said he traveled to Ibadan with three of his friends with the intention of apprehending the culprit for three days.
After they sent him to the state, they advertised for him in a hotel where they stayed before they started looking for him.
It was gathered that the three persons had taken him to where he bought the foodstuff in the town, but they decided to arrest him due to the high level of public disturbance in the area.
Later, the villagers caught him while he was alone in his market stall.

This information came from the General Manager, Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in an interview with our representative at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, at the beginning of the month.
He said the company had been dormant for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was difficult to revive it, which then gave the order to remove N78.8 million to repair the important components of the company with an additional N48 million to operate it, which gave the company the opportunity to take off again.
Eng. Gadaka further stated that this gave them the impetus to purchase the necessary equipment to start operations in the company, which included a new 500 KbA electric power generator (Generator), 500 KbA electric power distribution device (Transformer), a new engine for lifting bulk materials, an engine for drilling bulk materials (modern) and other equipment required by the company.
Then he paused and said, "Furthermore, the main purpose of this initiative of Governor Buni, in reviving this company is to provide jobs for the youth, while reducing unemployment and providing revenue for Yobe State".
Listen Carefully.
On the other hand, he said the company has received overwhelming patronage, due to the way the Yobe State Government has patronized the Potiskum-based Yobe Flour and Feed Mill and other market outlets that stock the company's products.
He said that the government's efforts to improve the modern railway company is also a factor in buying the products that the company sells.
On the other hand, he said, "We are facing some challenges due to the way the company has been closed for over 10 years while engines have started to work but we need to modify some equipment to be able to operate without any fear".
Before our tasks commence, we will endeavor to bring in the other supplies we need.
Furthermore, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we are requesting the Yobe State Government to provide us with additional equipment, a large truck for carrying goods and motorcycles that we can use to facilitate our operations easily, especially for transporting our staff to the office to avoid going out in the midst of the pandemic when we started working from home."

The Nigerian government has changed its stance on student testing.
The Nigerian government has changed its stance on denying school-leavers the opportunity to sit for examinations, following its new stance of reopening secondary schools from 4th of next month to conduct examinations.
The Spokesperson of the Nigerian Ministry of Education Ben Goong has stated that the government has reaffirmed its commitment to the commencement of the examination scheduled to start on the 17th of August.
The official said that schools will open on the 4th of next month and will give students in grade 3 of senior high school the opportunity to prepare for two weeks before the exam.
This new stance has overruled the one taken by the Minister of Education Adamu Adamu which declared a suspension of physical examinations due to the increasing cases of coronavirus in Nigeria.
When he was making the statement after taking that stance, the minister who said that the responsibility of Nigerian students is his, said that he would not hesitate to cancel the exams entirely this year to protect the health of the children.
This stance has been met with opposition from various quarters including the Nigerian House of Representatives regarding the ban on students completing their studies undertaking examinations.

A total of 2,732 people were killed in Nigeria between April and June - Report
An estimated 2,732 people were killed in Nigeria in the two months from April to June.
SBM Intelligence, a research firm based in Lagos, has reported that it has compiled data from various newspapers published in the country.
The report compiled statistics from newspapers including killings by Boko Haram, kidnappings by bandits, attacks by armed groups, raids by militants and killings related to ethnicity and tribalism in border regions.
This collaborative research project is between SBM Intelligence and an organization called "Enough is Enough".
In April, SBM released a report on the number of homicides of nearly 1,000 people that newspapers reported had been committed between January and March 2020.
SBM stated that the report draws evidence from security sector stakeholders, civil society organizations focused on security sector reform both domestically and abroad.
And all the list of group names.
